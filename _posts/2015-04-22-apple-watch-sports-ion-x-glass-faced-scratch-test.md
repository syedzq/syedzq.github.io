Spoilers: the glass handled keys(?), a knife and steel wool, but the sandpaper managed to scratch it.

> While a key, a knife, and steel wool don&#8217;t do any damage to the glass, Hilsenteger is able to scratch the glass quite significantly with sandpaper, suggesting that while it will stand up to day to day wear and tear, it&#8217;s still possible to scratch the Ion-X glass under extreme conditions. 

This is ridiculous. I doubt anyone would keep the Apple Watch in their pocket like a pocket watch, so there&#8217;s no way keys would scratch the watch. I&#8217;m not sure anyone would scratch something on their wrist with a material like sandpaper. This video (and the article) is absurd.
