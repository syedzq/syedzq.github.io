&#8220;But there is one last thing,&#8221; said Steve Jobs.
  
It was September 12, 2006. Apple had just unveiled iTunes 7, introducing Movies to the iTunes Store. It was Apple&#8217;s &#8220;It&#8217;s Showtime!&#8221; event, and earlier that day, Jobs had announced updates to iPods (which were still Apple&#8217;s staple electronic device, and were selling extremely well), and the iTunes Store.
  
&#8220;This next thing’s a little unusual for us. It’s a sneak peek for a product that will be announced in the first calendar quarter of 2007.&#8221;
  
Jobs tied up the entertainment-themed event by unveiling the &#8220;iTV&#8221;, which was not the final product name<sup id="fnref-323-1"><a href="#fn-323-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.

The iTV resembled a thinner Mac Mini. Steve Jobs promised &#8220;no power bricks&#8221; &#8211; the power supply was built-in. It had Wi-Fi and Ethernet, USB 2.0, and HDMI interfaces.

However, the software running on the iTV was less interesting. It features a slightly modified version of the Front Row interface. It seemed like Apple changed a few lines of code, and bundled Front Row.app into the iTV.

Nevertheless, _the main function of the iTV was to play movies and TV shows purchased from iTunes on a big screen_. Although the case may be different now, with the success of streaming services like Netflix and HBO Go, if Apple showed off movies and TV shows in iTunes Store alone, customers would have been without a way to enjoy the content on a big screen. The iTV&#8217;s software seemed like a rushed decision &#8211; it didn&#8217;t seem like Steve Jobs to do that. The iTV finally launched in March 2007 as Apple TV.

Today, the Apple TV catches a lot of flak for not being powerful enough. It&#8217;s compared with competitors&#8217; devices such as the Roku, Amazon Fire TV and Google&#8217;s Chromecast. The problem is, it&#8217;s not a fair comparison. The Apple TV is a companion device to iTunes, your iPhone, your iPad and your Mac. It&#8217;s meant to be an accessory for your iTunes content. The main function of the Apple TV is to be a means to play your iTunes content on your television. That&#8217;s it. It reduces the friction of plugging in your Mac into the TV. The third-party programming (Netflix, HBO Go) is all thrown in, and is great, but deviates from the original purpose of the Apple TV. It&#8217;s where the line blurs. The $99 it will set you back is an illusion &#8211; the Apple TV is an expensive accessory, not a cheap device.

The competitors, the Fire TV, the Chromecast or the Roku are fully fledged streaming devices. These options are good for anyone, because they offer to work with any streaming service (except iTunes), and it&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t matter what ecosystem you&#8217;re tied to, because you can use them.

But the Apple TV is just a means to play iTunes content. Apple customers are already invested in iTunes, having purchased far too many songs, movies, TV shows and apps to switch ecosystems. The Apple TV supports streaming services as a side, but ultimately, it&#8217;s just to stream, purchase and rent iTunes content.

Instead of being a really bad set-top box, the Apple TV is a really good accessory<sup id="fnref-323-2"><a href="#fn-323-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.

## But it&#8217;s 2015&#8230;

&#8230;and people want more out of this accessory. Apple has to update the Apple TV more frequently, with substantial upgrades. Here&#8217;s how Apple can use the strengths in their ecosystem improve the Apple TV.

### Opening up Apple TV to Developers

Apple has a great developer community supporting them, itching to get their apps on as many devices as possible. By opening up Apple TV to developers, they can ensure good content, apps and games are added to the Apple TV. Google can create their own custom version of YouTube (the design of the stock YouTube app looks outdated), and local news networks can create their own channels for the Apple TV.

### Use Apple Technologies & Features.

Siri. A8X processor with Metal. Apple has so many awesome technologies available only on iOS and OS X that would be a great fit on the Apple TV.

### A Bluetooth Remote

The current (terrible) line-of-sight remote doesn&#8217;t work if you want to hide your Apple TV. A Bluetooth remote means you don&#8217;t have to point your remote at the Apple TV.

The Apple TV has far outgrown the &#8216;hobby&#8217; categorization. 2015 seems to be the perfect time to get on this for Apple. Tim Cook himself has admitted that television is an area of intense interest. The Apple TV is one of Apple&#8217;s weakest product lines. 2015 may be the year Apple decides to change that.

  It was finally called the Apple TV as we know it, because <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/02/13/britains-itv-warns-apple-again-not-to-use-itv/">ITV</a>, a British TV network threatened to sue Apple for the name.&#160;<a href="#fnref-323-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

<li id="fn-323-2">
  In fact, the Apple TV is categorized under &#8216;iPod&#8217; in their sitemap and their product organization.&#160;<a href="#fnref-323-2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
