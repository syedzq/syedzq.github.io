iOS 9 is a huge update for the iPad, and an impressive one for iOS in general. This post by [David Chartier](http://twitter.com/davidchartier) is a good list of the new features, and includes both big features and little tricks that change the game for iOS users.

Here&#8217;s one I really like:

> iPad in landscape now displays two columns of widgets in Notification Center, allowing more space to quickly access important info and app actions. 

This feature is nice. Not needed, but nice to have.
