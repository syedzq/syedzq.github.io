iOS 9 was announced this year at WWDC, and brought a variety of changes and new and improved APIs for developers, opening up possibilities for developers and users alike. One of the changes developers can take advantage of is a new addition to the extensions lineup introduced last year: content blocking. This allows developers to write scripts (well, just a [JSON script, actually](https://gist.github.com/CraftyDeano/777579c628b3d8d50f25)) that blocks third-party tracking scripts and elements reserved for ad space.

[Dean Murphy did just that](http://murphyapps.co/blog/2015/6/24/an-hour-with-safari-content-blocker-in-ios-9), and found that with sites like [iMore](http://imore.com), removing all the tracking scripts and ad spaces reduced loading speed from 11 seconds down to 2. For the user, this type of move is a win — less waiting, a lot less for cellular networks to load, and overall a good user experience, making both the user and Apple happy. But what about the publishers?

Naturally, after [Daring Fireball linked to the piece](https://daringfireball.net/2015/07/safari_content_blocker_imore), people started paying attention to the debate. Most notably, iMore editor-in-chief, Rene Ritchie [wrote a response to it](http://www.imore.com/and-hour-safari-content-blockers-and-imore) — basically saying the Mobile Nations is already too invested in network ads to switch from them.

Recently, however, they ran an op-ed from James Thomson — yes, _that_ [James Thomson](http://twitter.com/jamesthomson), who voiced his disapproval at ad-blocking.

> So turn off that ad-blocker, or at least white-list sites you enjoy. Don&#8217;t pirate stuff telling yourself that &#8220;you&#8217;ll buy it later if you really like it&#8221;. You know that&#8217;s never going to happen. Subscribe to websites and support creators directly via Kickstarter and Patreon. Don&#8217;t complain because the developers of the ridiculously cheap app you use every single day on the $1000 supercomputer in your pocket have asked for a tiny sum of money so they can eat. After all, we all get to decide the future we want to see. 

And, almost in response to this, [Marco Arment wrote about this issue](http://www.marco.org/2015/08/11/ad-blocking-ethics):

> People often argue that running ad-blocking software is violating an implied contract between the reader and the publisher: the publisher offers the page content to the reader for free, in exchange for the reader seeing the publisher’s ads. And that’s a nice, simple theory, but it’s a blurry line in reality.
> 
> By that implied-contract theory, readers should not only permit their browsers to load the ads, but they should actually read each one, giving themselves a chance to develop an interest for the advertised product or service and maybe even click on it and make a purchase. That’s also a nice theory, but of course, it’s ridiculous to expect anyone to actually do that. Publishers are lucky if people even read the content with any real attention today, let alone the ads around it. 

I agree with Marco. The idea that readers should view and interact with ads in exchange for (freely) reading the publisher&#8217;s ads is outdated, considering the nefarious deed networks go through to make readers notice their ads. I do run an ad-blocker, but I _always_, without fail, whitelist the sites of independent writers, and publishers I love reading, no matter how hideous their ads are (and in my experience, none do).

In fact, I don&#8217;t notice if I have an ad-blocker on for sites that do have good ads: [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net), [Marco.org](http://marco.org), and [512 Pixels](http://512pixels.net) just to name a few. This is because these writers pick and choose sponsors based on how much they themselves want to see them. With larger sites, it&#8217;s much harder to keep away from networks, but [MacStories](http://macstories.net) and [Six Colors](http://sixcolors.com) have pulled it off wonderfully. Without these sites, I&#8217;d never have discovered excellent products like [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com), [Automatic](http://automatic.com), and [Fracture](http://fractureme.com).

There&#8217;s a lesson big publishers can learn from indies: there are better ad networks — [Carbon](http://carbonads.net), [The Deck](http://decknetwork.net), as well as doing sponsored posts for products you like.

In the age of large sites using ridiculous and devious ads to market to their readers (especially on mobile), it&#8217;s clear that content-blocking (_not_ ad-blocking — trackers must go too), will prevail, just as pop-up blockers that ship with browsers have. In fact, I think content-blockers will become an industry standard, just like pop-up blockers, especially with the biggest company in the world standing behind it.
