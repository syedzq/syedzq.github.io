All great iOS games eventually find their way to Android. Alto&#8217;s Adventure, a hit this year, is now coming to Android and Kindle Fire, in collaboration with [Noodlecake Studios](http://www.noodlecake.com/).

Here&#8217;s Ryan Cash, co-founder of Snowman, on the news:

> A lot of people have been asking, and today we can finally confirm: Alto’s Adventure is coming soon to Android and Kindle Fire.
> 
> We’re teaming up with the awesome guys at Noodlecake Studios to make this happen. They’ve made a bunch of really cool games themselves, and have helped small indies bring their iOS games over to Android. We’re really excited to be working with them!
