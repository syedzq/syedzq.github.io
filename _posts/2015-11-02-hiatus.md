I&#8217;ll have to stop writing for a while now because things are getting busy at school. I&#8217;m going into my [GCSE years](http://www.wikipedia.com/en/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education) and I need to prioritize my studies before my own hobbies (although I hate to call this that). I&#8217;m not happy with making this decision but I need to do this in order to focus on my own future. As CGP Grey outlines in [his own post](http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/dialing-down), it seems like taking a break to focus on something more important seems right.

While I won&#8217;t update this site for a while (perhaps a couple months), you can still find me and my terrible jokes, quips, and incorrect commentary on technology on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/syedzq).
