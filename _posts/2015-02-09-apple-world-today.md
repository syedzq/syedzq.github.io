A new Apple website from former TUAW&#8217;ers. They&#8217;ve highlighted a new focus for Apple World Today – they&#8217;re now working on longer articles rather than repeated news offerings. Here&#8217;s a snippet from one of their [first posts](http://www.appleworld.today/blog/2015/2/1/rip-tech-blogging-welcome-to-the-future):

> We&#8217;re big fans of Federico Viticci&#8217;s posts on MacStories, and while we probably won&#8217;t be writing 10,000 word reviews of Workflow anytime soon (we kid, Federico), we want to make our posts &#8212; when possible &#8212; more detailed and in-depth. Dave Caolo&#8217;s post on Alfred Remote is perhaps the best example of this, as it includes an interview with Vero Pepperrell of Running With Crayons about the process that went into creating the app. 

They&#8217;re also open to all kinds of feedback, so hit them up on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/appleworldtoday) to give them a few comments.
