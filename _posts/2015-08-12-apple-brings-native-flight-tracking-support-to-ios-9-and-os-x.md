Great addition to OS X and iOS, and appears to tie in to Proactive Assistant.

> Discovered by a Reddit user on Wednesday, Apple&#8217;s new flight tracking feature is already functional in the latest iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan beta builds, though data detectors are for now limited to Mail, Messages and Notes. 

I&#8217;ve personally had to search up a lot of flights on Google, and this feature is welcome to me.
