Benedict Evans, [writing on his eponymous weblog](http://ben-evans.com):

> This is why thinking about &#8216;mobile&#8217; as another bullet point next to &#8216;SEO&#8217; misses the point: mobile becomes the platform, and it&#8217;s a much richer and more powerful one. What happens when almost everyone on earth has a pocket supercomputer connected to the internet? It&#8217;s not a subset of the internet &#8211; it IS the internet. 

My views align with this opinion — it&#8217;s easy to think of the &#8216;mobile web&#8217; — and again, I hate to use that term — as anything less than that of the desktop web. With responsive design, and the accessibility of mobile devices, more and more websites _must_ provide the full experience to the user.

TL;DR: Website creators can&#8217;t offer to limit their sites to mobile users — a lot more readers can potentially miss out on the full experience.
