> JetBlue has become the first U.S. airline to accept Apple Pay in-flight, meaning customers can use their iPhone to purchase snack boxes, premium items, etc. from the airline. 

About time. This should expand to other airlines too. I wonder how it&#8217;ll work for international flights – perhaps it&#8217;ll be the same, with the US credit card being used for payment. I wouldn&#8217;t know.
