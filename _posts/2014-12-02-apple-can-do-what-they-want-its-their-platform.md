[Marco Arment](http://marco.org "Marco Arment"), founder of Instapaper and creator of Tumblr on Apple&#8217;s new decision to promote (RED) via push notificatioms:<article> 

> Regardless of the cause, this is clearly a promotion, will annoy thousands or millions of people, and is in direct violation of the least-enforced rule in the App Store.

> If Apple won’t enforce its own standards against spamming and annoying customers — which really isn’t good enough — the least they can do is practice the rules themselves and be a good example.

I disagree with most of the points in this article. When third-party applications promote in-app purchases for which they get 70% of the profit, people are complaining that Apple promotes buying apps for which 100% of the profit goes straight to charity?

Of course, this isn&#8217;t the first time Apple has &#8220;violated&#8221; it&#8217;s own rules &#8211; Xcode was available on the Mac App Store for two years with an installation package. If I remember correctly, third-party Mac App Store applications are not allowed to have installers as they could not &#8220;execute other code&#8221;. Apple has complete precedence over what they do, as it is their own platform. They can do as they see fit, they don&#8217;t need to follow their own rules. Last I checked, Apple&#8217;s App Store Guidelines are for third-party developers, not themselves. They don&#8217;t need to set examples for others &#8211; rather, I think individual developers should be setting examples and become models for the developers that _do_ violate rules and get away with it. As much as people think the Apple ecosystem is a dictatorship, I believe there is certainly room for developers to rise up and become role models for others. And Apple rewards them as seen fit.</article>
