John Gruber in response to Steven Berlin Johnson&#8217;s excellent piece on the role of the Digital Crown to the Apple Watch:

> I would keep the functionality of the crown button as-is:
> 
>   * If the watch display is off, pressing the crown wakes it up.
>   * If the watch is showing your glances or notifications, pressing the crown takes you back to the watch face.
>   * If the watch is displaying your watch face, pressing the crown switches you to the home screen showing all your apps.
>   * If you&#8217;re using any app, pressing the crown takes you back to the home screen, with the view centered on the app you just left.
>   * If the watch is on your home screen and the clock app is not centered, pressing it will re-center.
>   * If the watch is on the home screen, centered on the clock, pressing it will switch you to the watch face.
