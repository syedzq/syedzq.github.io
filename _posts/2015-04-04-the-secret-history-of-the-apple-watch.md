A great read, by David Pierce for Wired. His piece goes in-depth about the human interface group&#8217;s (run by Alan Dye) work for the Apple Watch, and Kevin Lynch&#8217;s work on the Apple Watch. It&#8217;s worth reading the whole thing, but here&#8217;s the good bits:

> “We’re so connected, kind of ever-presently, with technology now,” Lynch says. “People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much.” They’ve glared down their noses at those who bury themselves in their phones at the dinner table and then absentmindedly thrust hands into their own pockets at every ding or buzz. “People want that level of engagement,” Lynch says. “But how do we provide it in a way that’s a little more human, a little more in the moment when you’re with somebody?” 

This is the main reason the Watch was born. It&#8217;s because of a problem that Apple co-created among many other smartphone makers. The incessant checking of phones, every single time there&#8217;s a notification. It&#8217;s the reason phones are thrown into bags at the start of every dinner, the reason scientists are worried for children. And as the article goes on to say, it&#8217;s why Apple is out to fix this issue with the Apple Watch.

> Lynch is leaning forward in his chair, telling me about his kids: about how grateful he is to be able to simply glance at his Watch, realize that the latest text message isn’t immediately important, and then go right back to family time; about how that doesn’t feel disruptive to him—or them.

> A moment later, he stands up. He has to leave; he owes Dye and Ive an update on something important. In all the time we’ve been talking, he’s never once looked at his phone.
