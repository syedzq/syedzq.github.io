Interesting opinion here by Neil Cybart, but one I thoroughly agree with.

> While the press has run with the Apple Music versus Spotify storyline, in reality, Apple&#8217;s music ambitions are much more grandiose. Apple is once again trying to build music sustainability by selling an all-encompassing music service. There is precedent for such lofty goals as the iTunes ecosystem presented the music industry with a much needed reprieve from the rise of piracy and genuine questions of music&#8217;s sustainability. Apple relied on a service that capitalized on ease of use to stoke demand for paid music downloads. Ten years later, while things may have not changed much as labels are still making short-term decisions guided by money, and there are renewed questions around music sustainability, we now live in a world where free music subscriptions are gaining momentum and acceptance. 

Free streaming is too big for Apple to ignore, especially since Apple Music&#8217;s free trial still requires a credit card to sign up with, breaking the deal for most young people.
