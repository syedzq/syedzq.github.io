In a [previous post](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2014/12/07/apps-of-the-week/) I mentioned my approval of [Typed](http://realmacsoftware.com/typed), by Realmac Software.

> Realmac is definitely one of the well renown developers for both iOS and Mac. It’s amazing how a small team like them have created apps for so many different markets. Typed is just another amazing addition to their portfolio, and I definitely agree it’s the best markdown editor so far. It feels like it was tailor-made for Yosemite with the little additions Realmac Software is known for. 

In fact, Realmac is a team of _seven_ people. According to their [website](http://realmacsoftware.com), only six people work on projects together in Brighton, whereas another individual is based in Sweden.

Yet, every single application they’ve managed to create has been sensational so far. [RapidWeaver](http://realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver) is a household name for small businesses who want to set up websites but can’t pay for professional web design. [Clear](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear) is the most beautiful and simplest to-do list app I’ve ever seen (and the sound effects are awesome too). I don’t use Clear anymore, now that my projects have evolved I prefer [Todoist](http://todoist.com) for a project- and collaboration-based workflow, but sometimes I launch Clear just to see the beautiful interface (something Todoist doesn&#8217;t have) and to hear those signature sound effects. Call me crazy. I’ve never used Ember, but I’ve heard it being called the “Evernote of pictures”. A worthy title.

So when Realmac introduced [Typed](http://realmacsoftware.com/blog/typed-for-mac-is-here), their first markdown editor for Mac, I was gripped with fervor. Never before had I seen such an elegant-looking app, perfectly optimized for OS X Yosemite, with translucent windows, and even slight modifications to Apple&#8217;s default UI elements (for example, the minimal formatting bar has been modified to match the brown color scheme of the app, while retaining Yosemite&#8217;s distinct look and feel for UI elements).

So here&#8217;s a review of Typed:

## Design & User Interface {#designuserinterface}<figure> 

<img src="http://zaidsyed.com/images/a.png" alt="a" width="525" height="319" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-173" srcset="http://zaidsyed.com/blog/images/a.png 516w, http://zaidsyed.com/blog/images/a-300x182.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /><figcaption>The app icon is beautiful.</figcaption></figure> 

When you first launch Typed, you&#8217;ll see a gorgeous, blank document that, following the Yosemite design cues, blurs the wallpaper behind to create a sense of context. Typed&#8217;s user interface is incredibly simple. You don&#8217;t see sidebars, clunky toolbars or a panel dedicated to needless formatting &#8211; all you see is your text and the title bar, which lets you rename, save and move your text file. When your mouse is inactive for more than five seconds, even the title bar will disappear, allowing you to focus only on your work. You&#8217;ll see inspirational quotes which are all too familiar if you&#8217;ve used Clear before. While Clear&#8217;s quotes are all about productivity, Typed&#8217;s quotes are all about writing.<figure>

While Typed follows many of the new [OS X Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/), it also includes some slight UI modifications Realmac is known for. In case you were wondering where you can format your text, mousing over the left margin reveals the minimal set of buttons, where you can format text, preview your document, or share your text as HTML or Markdown.

This is Typed&#8217;s only toolbar (if "toolbar" is an appropriate term in this case). It shares many characteristics with the native UI elements, but are modified to match the color schemes.<figure> 

<img src="http://zaidsyed.com/images/Screen-Shot-2014-12-09-at-7.02.39-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-09 at 7.02.39 PM" width="262" height="197" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-180" srcset="http://zaidsyed.com/blog/images/Screen-Shot-2014-12-09-at-7.02.39-PM.png 534w, http://zaidsyed.com/blog/images/Screen-Shot-2014-12-09-at-7.02.39-PM-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px" /><img src="http://zaidsyed.com/images/native.png" alt="native" width="262" height="134" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-178" srcset="http://zaidsyed.com/blog/images/native.png 370w, http://zaidsyed.com/blog/images/native-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px" /><figcaption>It&#8217;s very similar to the native UI elements.</figcaption></figure> 

In this way, the Typed team has found the perfect compromise between consistency between the OS and consistency within the app.

Typed&#8217;s UI design allows for an easy and distraction-free writing experience. That phrase has been used a lot, but it certainly applies to Typed. Typed&#8217;s focus on simplicity does however, mean that much of the function is crammed into the menu bar. Features such as selecting formatting through the GUI is done through the "Format" bar, and with keyboard shortcuts. The "View" menu allows you to view fonts (more on that later) and hide and show the subtle word and character count. The most interesting menu, however, is entitled "Zen".

## The Zen Mode, and the Writing Experience {#thezenmodeandthewritingexperience}

On of the main selling points, i.e what ideally should differentiate Typed from other markdown editors is the "Zen Mode". Zen Mode is Typed&#8217;s version of iA Writer&#8217;s Focus Mode. Entering Zen Mode (⌘Y) automatically takes Typed full screen and starts playing the soundtrack (more on that below).

Writing is the main feature of this app, and it does it well. It allows me to be focused, and navigate my entire articles exclusively with my keyboard, which makes writing more efficient, with less breaks in writing when trying to find my cursor.

The extent of your formatting extends to any type of HTML and Markdown, however the only documented formatting you can do (in the "Format" menu) is bold, italic, blockquotes, headings from sizes 1-6 (think `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5` and `h6` in HTML), and links (⌘K) and images (⌥⌘I). This alone is what most authors need. However, the extent of Markdown (and HTML) allows you to create:

  * lists, and,
  * `code`

Although adding images is as it would be in Markdown, I wish there was a more intuitive way to add images to type and generate the Markdown code automatically. By default, dragging an image in provides the full path to the image, although you have to input any UTF-8 ASCII (for example a space is &#8216;%20&#8217;) if your path has any spaces in it.

Authors are also available to customize the typeface to the following via the formatting toolbar (to the left of the screen):

  * Typed Pro, what seems to be a custom-made serif font that comes with Typed, based on Gentium,
  * Menlo, a monospaced sans-serif type,
  * Avenir Next, a beautiful modern san-serif font,
  * Helvetica Neue, used across both OS X and iOS as the default system font,
  * Courier, another monospaced font (used for screenplays),
  * and Georgia, a popular serif typeface

This list may seem restrictive, and you can&#8217;t enable Apple&#8217;s default font panel with a ⌘T to select other typefaces, like Evernote and other apps.

If you&#8217;re wondering where you can set font-size and margins, you&#8217;ll have to disable "Responsive Layout". Responsive Layout changes font-size and margins relative to the window. Once you disable it, you can set the font-size and margins as you like.<figure>

Typed also allows three themes, light mode, dark mode, and a "sepia" mode, which is especially pleasant. Light and sepia mode work with Yosemite&#8217;s translucency, and I definitely prefer these over night mode, which I don&#8217;t like to write with even at night. The themes are well-crafted and extremely well-designed and have great contrast. (Also, the cursor is green in light mode, red in sepia, and grey in dark mode).

### A (Short) Section on Sound {#ashortsectiononsound}

Realmac has _always_ cared about sound in their apps. Clear has excellent use of sound in navigating to-do lists. With Typed Realmac went as far as contacting developers with audio experience, such as [Taptanium](http://taptanium), who make apps with great audio content. Officially credited are:

> # Music and Sound {#musicandsound}
> 
> **Nature sounds:**
> 
> Taptanium
> 
> Buddha Machine
  
> Christiaan Virant and Zhang Jian
> 
> **All other music and interface sounds:**
> 
> Josh Mobley
> 
> **Audio encoding wizardry courtesy:**
> 
> Marius Masalar 

And the result is extraordinary. Going into Zen Mode automatically takes Typed full screen and starts playing one out of eight soundtracks. You can pause soundtracks with "⇧⌘.", and skip forward to the next or previous track by pressing ⇧⌘] and ⇧⌘[ respectively.

To choose a soundtrack manually, you can go into Typed&#8217;s preferences with a &#8220;⌘.&#8221; (once again, very minimal) and select from eight different soundtracks.

Here, you can see beautiful illustrations of the "sounds of nature" (these illustrations were done by [Harry Nesbitt](http://www.harrynesbitt.com)), and disable the UI sounds.

The sounds that come with Typed are intuitive and doesn&#8217;t make your mind wander. It&#8217;s not distracting, and lets you focus on the task at hand.

## Publishing {#publishing}

Once you&#8217;re satisfied with your writing, you can preview your text. Typed converts your Markdown into "normal" text. Interestingly, changing the typeface while writing does _not_ affect the font of the preview, which I find&#8230;odd.

Once you&#8217;ve previewed our work and happy with it, there are a few ways to share your writing. By hovering over on the left margin, you can click the "share" button (familiar for post-iOS 7 and Yosemite users) and select "Copy as HTML". Your whole article will be copies to the clipboard, ready to paste into whatever you use to publish posts. You can also share your .md files via Mail, Messages or AirDrop, but that&#8217;s the limit.

Publishing is the one place where Typed fails, with _extremely_ limited options &#8211; you can only export as an HTML file or as a rich text file.

Despite the few options for publishing, the "Copy as HTML" function may really be all you need &#8211; it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve ever needed.

Just remember, Typed is no [Byword](https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12) when it comes to publishing in-app &#8211; it&#8217;s just a writing app.

## Verdict {#verdict}

Typed is a beautiful and distraction-free writing app, but it&#8217;s neither the simplest writing program, nor the most professional Markdown editor ever. If you make heavy use of Markdown and lean towards to more advanced features, you&#8217;re better off with [IA Writer Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/ia-writer-pro/id775737590?mt=12) or [BBEdit](https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/bbedit/id404009241?mt=12). Typed is aimed towards the middle ground, or just for those who use the basic features of Markdown, and just want to concentrate on writing.

Because that&#8217;s just what Typed is. It&#8217;s just an app for those who just want to write.

### Rating {#rating}

#### 8.5/10 {#8.510}

##### Pros: {#pros:}

  * Clean, clutter-free UI
  * "Zen Mode" is a great way to focus on your writing
  * Soundtracks are great, and helps keep your mind only on the writing task at hand

##### Cons: {#cons:}

  * Frequent crashes and saving bugs, revisions are not managed correctly and get overwritten constantly
  * Cannot export to multiple formats and publish online in-app*
  * No iPhone or iPad app (yet!), with no formal iCloud or syncing support**

*It&#8217;s important to note that Typed is just an app for writing, not publishing. That said, the developers should add more exporting options so that authors can publish their documents easily.

**Typed is available on the [Realmac Store](http://sites.fastspring.com/realmacsoftware/product/all). As it&#8217;s not available on the Mac App Store, it doesn&#8217;t support iCloud, and can&#8217;t use it to sync across your Mac devices. However, you can use iCloud Drive to edit and view them across all your devices.
