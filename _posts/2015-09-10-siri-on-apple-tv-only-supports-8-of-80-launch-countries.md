> Buried in the developer documentation for tvOS is confirmation that Apple will actually ship two Apple TV packages: one with the new Siri Remote and the other with what the company is calling the Apple TV Remote. Only consumers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, the UK and the U.S. will receive the Siri Remote.
> 
> All others will receive the Apple TV Remote, which — aside from not having access to Siri — is functionally identical. Pressing the Siri button on this secondary remote will bring up the onscreen search app, presumably allowing users to enter their query manually. 

Huge frowny face, Apple. This is a deal breaker for a lot of people like me.
