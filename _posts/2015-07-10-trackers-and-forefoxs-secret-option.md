> “Likewise, I think it’s absurd to say, “If you won’t load [any or all] ads, you’re stealing.” It’s an extreme position, especially when sites reference 10 or 20 or 30 tracking elements. About half my paychecks as a freelancer come from sites for which advertising is key, and the other half from sites for which subscriptions pay a good part or a large part of the bills. (Ads for subscriptions are ads, too, of course.) The rise of ad blockers will hurt some sites and services, but also lead to development of other kinds of reader revenue, including more paywalls.” 

I'm a staunch supporter of using adblockers. I use them for the news sites I visit that clearly don't lose much if I block their ads, but I _always_ whitelist ads on the sites run by smaller groups and individuals whom I respect. These people make their money from ads after publishing honest, free work, and I'm not going to deny them their money. I also try and use affiliate links from people when purchasing iTunes content or when shopping on Amazon.
