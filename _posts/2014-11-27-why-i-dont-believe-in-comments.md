The reason social media exists is to share content and your opinion on said content. Not to start mini-Internet flame wars. The growth of social media has meant that on-site comments have decreased in popularity.

[Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net/2007/06/comments-a-lack-thereof/ "Comments - Shawn Blanc") on the very same topic, but with an interesting viewpoint:

> Comments can be like a mini popularity contest. When you visit here, I don’t want each post to get sized up to the others. Following [Craig](http://furbo.org/) & [John’s](http://daringfireball.net/) lead, there will be no comments or trackbacks on shawnblanc.net.
