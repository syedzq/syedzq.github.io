John Gruber weighs in on tomorrow Apple events. The most interesting part is that Gruber does not think everything will be announced tomorrow, and for the most part, I agree with him:

> Not only does the two-event scenario seem more likely to me, I’d go so far as to call the one-event scenario inexplicable. Possible, sure. But not logical. 

Same — with just the iPhones, Apple Watch updates, _and_ Apple TV, we&#8217;re looking at a 2-hour event here. With another &#8216;flagship&#8217; product tomorrow, we&#8217;re definitely going to exceed that by at least another hour, which even new Apple wouldn&#8217;t dare exceed — WWDC got pretty boring around the Apple Music part.
