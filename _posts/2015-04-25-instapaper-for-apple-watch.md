Betaworks has launched their Instapaper Apple Watch app. Yes.

While it&#8217;s impossible to imagine people reading on their smartwatches, Instapaper for Apple Watch appears to only allow text-to-speech readings of the article by the now famous &#8220;Samantha&#8221; voice from your Apple Watch, which is ingenious.

You can also use Force Tap to archive, move to a folder, and do most of the other things you can already do to an article on Instapaper&#8217;s other clients. And, naturally, this is perfectly synced, right down to the word.
