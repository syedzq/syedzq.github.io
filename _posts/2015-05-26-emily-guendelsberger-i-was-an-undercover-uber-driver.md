Fascinating piece I finally got around to reading about UberX drivers and how much they actually earn.

I recently tried out the Uber app myself a couple weeks ago. It was around 8 o&#8217;clock, and there was a huge line for taxis. When the Uber app was finally set up, it showed no cars available, and a ten-minute wait for a taxi. The rate would have been around $150 (Hong Kong Dollars), which is about 20 USD, which is way too much for a fairly short distance which would have been $10 (USD). The normal cab line ended up being faster than the Uber, and much less expensive.
