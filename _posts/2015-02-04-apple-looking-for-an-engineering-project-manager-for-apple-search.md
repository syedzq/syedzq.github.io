This is huge. While this job posting could just be for enhanced Spotlight and Siri, it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;re much closer to Apple&#8217;s own search engine now, especially with [Apple&#8217;s search agreement with Google for Safari ending this year](https://www.theinformation.com/All-Eyes-on-Apple-as-Google-Search-Deal-Expires-Next-Year).

Here&#8217;s what Apple said in the job description:

> Apple seeks a technical, driven and creative program manager to manage backend operations projects for a search platform supporting hundreds of millions of users. Play a part in revolutionizing how people use their computers and mobile devices. Manage operational projects that support groundbreaking technology and the most scalable big-data systems in existence.
