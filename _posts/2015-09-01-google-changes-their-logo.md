Google has changed their logo — yes, again. They dropped their drop shadow shortly after iOS 7 was released, but now they&#8217;ve took on an Alphabet-inspired logo. It&#8217;s essentially the same thing, but set in the font Alphabet&#8217;s is.

> It doesn’t simply tell you that you’re using Google, but also shows you how Google is working for you. For example, new elements like a colorful Google mic help you identify and interact with Google whether you’re talking, tapping or typing. Meanwhile, we’re bidding adieu to the little blue “g” icon and replacing it with a four-color “G” that matches the logo. 

Firstly, some design critique: four colors for tiny icons seems a bit heavy, in terms of color scheme, but they&#8217;re primary colors anyway. I&#8217;d rather they elected just three at the most to stick to, because at small sizes, a four-color microphone icon is going to look rather crappy.
