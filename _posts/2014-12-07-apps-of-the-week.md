[Typed](http://realmacsoftware.com/typed):

> Realmac is most well known for making Clear, a quality todo app for iOS that’s pretty popular. Typed serves a little more of a niche market, but for those interested in a minimalist, easy to use Markdown editor for the Mac, it’s an excellent choice. 

Realmac is definitely one of the well known developers for both iOS and Mac. It’s amazing how a small team like them have created apps for so many different markets. Typed is just another amazing addition to their portfolio, and I definitely agree it’s the best markdown editor so far. It feels like it was tailor-made for Yosemite with the little additions Realmac Software is known for.

[Themeboard](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id908842747?mt=8):

> By bringing together some of the best mobile app designers out there, Themeboard has created an attractive repository of custom keyboard themes for iOS 8. 

I was originally psyched for third-party keyboards with iOS 8, but the lack of Dictation and the slow load times made me go back to the stock keyboard. Trying out Themeboard, I find there is no other functionality (swipe gestures, customizable rows, etc.) in any of the themes, which doesn’t appeal much to me beyond some of the slick ones, such as the “MACKPACK” &#8211; which looks exactly like Apple’s Wireless Keyboard that comes with the iMac.

[Caviar](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caviar-order-food-delivery/id931355786):

> The latter turned out to be the case with the release of the new Caviar iPhone app. See mouthwatering pictures of local dishes and have them delivered right to your door with the ability to track a delivery in transit. 

I’m interested in seeing how this ends up for Square.
