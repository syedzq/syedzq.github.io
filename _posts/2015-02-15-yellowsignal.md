I&#8217;m very proud and thrilled to introduce a new project I&#8217;ve been working on in collaboration with a long-time friend, [Harshit](http://harshit.in). It&#8217;s called [Yellow Signal](http://yellowsignal.com) and I hope you like it.

It&#8217;s a blog about modern technology and life, and we aim to write honest reviews, create helpful tutorials and publish interviews with people who we think our readership will love.

I know it may be a clich√©d genre for any blog, but we love it all the same. Starting this week, we&#8217;ll be publishing on Yellow Signal daily with app reviews, tutorials, interviews and anything we like.

You can check it out [here](http://yellowsignal.com), subscribe to our [RSS feed](http://yellowsignal.com/feed/) and get in touch with us [here](mailto:contact@yellowsignal.com).
