Wow. Just before WWDC, Apple&#8217;s updated their major professional Macs. The 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display receives the Force Touch trackpad that came with the new [MacBook](http://apple.com/macbook), as well as the usual better battery life and better internals. The _pro_ professional models even AMD graphics in favor of Nvidia. Even though I have a 2012 15&#8243; Pro, I still have some of that [#MacBookLust](https://twitter.com/hashtag/macbooklust).

Next up, the iMac with Retina 5K Display has a new, cheaper entry ($1999) with less powerful internals and a _spinning_ hard drive, not the Fusion Drive that comes with the high-end model.

Two points I&#8217;d like to make:

  * All of the Pro line has been updated with newer features, such as Force Touch, but none of the other features the MacBook has, because they seem to be only to reduce thickness. The one USB-C port (not to mention it being impractical for professional hardware not yet updated for Type-C), the butterfly keyboard and more is not needed for the Pro line, that can afford to be slightly thicker.</p> 
  * Just before WWDC. Expect an all-software keynote, but what can they talk about? I&#8217;m expecting _lots_ of Apple Watch and Apple TV software.
