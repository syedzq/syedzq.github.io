I get that ads on the web generally suck. I get that far too many sites use far too many invasive and maybe-some-should-be-illegal trackers. I get that performance is suffering across the board, and I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re finally starting the long conversation to fix it all.

This strategy is clever, but it does seem rather pushy — they may be &#8216;revolutionizing&#8217; the web by allowing content-blockers on the App Store, but it seems a lot like they just want to push publishers toward Apple News.

Publishers should either get creative with ads or go all-in on News.
