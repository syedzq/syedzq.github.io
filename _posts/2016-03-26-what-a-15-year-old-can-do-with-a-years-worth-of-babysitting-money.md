A fascinating open letter to Tim Cook by Zoe Olson, who [saved up a year&#8217;s worth of babysitting money](http://www.loopinsight.com/2016/03/24/young-designer-posts-note-to-tim-cook-about-ipad-pro-tim-cook-writes-back/#comment-2587148342) to buy an iPad Pro and Pencil to kickstart her illustrating career. At 15 (my own age), she bought an iPad Pro with her own money to start drawing and sharing her illustrations online. Soon enough, she got noticed by an author who asked her to illustrate for her children&#8217;s book.

To me, this is more than an apt description of the iPad Pro&#8217;s capabilities; it&#8217;s also about how young people can find exciting opportunities through the internet and modern technology not entirely possible just ten years ago. What&#8217;s more; Tim Cook replied to her email.
