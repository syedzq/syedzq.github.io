The app was built with the Apple Watch in mind, where I find it really awkward to enter locations into the Maps app. It also supports Apple Maps, Google Maps and Waze on the iPhone. 

Looks like a great new app, and a great video on how he makes them. Captain Underscore is one of the best indie developers out there.
