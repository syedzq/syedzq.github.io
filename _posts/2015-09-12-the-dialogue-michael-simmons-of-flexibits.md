[Beautiful Pixels](http://beautifulpixels.com) is one of my favorite sites to read — they review apps with great design, but they also have some great projects on the side, such as the recently launched [The Platter](http://theplatter.io).

They recently relaunched one of my favorite series, [The Dialogue](http://beautifulpixels.com/dialogue/), in which they interview app designers and developers. They&#8217;re really good because they&#8217;re in-depth and you can tell how much work goes into the interview.

The first interview for the relaunched Dialogue is with [Michael Simmons](http://twitter.com/macguitar) of [Flexibits](http://flexibits.com), who develop one of my favorite apps — [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical).

There&#8217;s a lot of good stuff in here.

Here&#8217;s a gem of advice for developers like me just starting out:

> “Set your expectations properly. It is not just a gold mine. Even with many successful apps, I’m still very aware of how much work and effort, and to an extent, how much luck and timing is involved. It isn’t a ‘Get Rich Quick’ scheme, it is a lot of hard work.&#8221;
