> We don’t need major OS releases every year. We don’t need each OS release to have a huge list of new features. We need our computers, phones, and tablets to work well first so we can enjoy new features released at a healthy, gradual, sustainable pace. 

I haven&#8217;t always [agreed with Marco Arment](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2014/12/02/apple-can-do-what-they-want-its-their-platform/ "Apple Can Do What They Want, It’s Their Platform"), but I totally agree with this piece. Apple&#8217;s not going into an impending doom &#8211; that&#8217;s completely untrue. But the quality of their software has decreased massively over the years, [similar to my earlier post](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2014/12/23/reliability/ "Reliability").

I am hugely satisfied with the feature set in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite. What I am not satisfied with is stability, and I&#8217;m glad others think so too.

Apple isn&#8217;t headed for a &#8216;nosedive&#8217;, but they need to get on this. They don&#8217;t need annual releases, they need a stable OS, and bug fixes.
