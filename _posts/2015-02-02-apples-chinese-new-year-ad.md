Ahead of the Chinese New Year (no, _not_ a Super Bowl ad) Apple has made essentially a China-targeted remake of &#8220;[The Song](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2014/12/16/the-song-apple/ "The Song")&#8220;. It&#8217;s still as touching, and shows Apple&#8217;s priorities for serving international customers as well as their American ones.

Equally remarkable is how little product placement there is.
