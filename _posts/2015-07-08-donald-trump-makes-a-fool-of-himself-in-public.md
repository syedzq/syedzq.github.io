I&#8217;m not into politics that much, but get a load of this:



In this video, he calls Bush a man with a low IQ, says Obama prefers to play gold than confront ISIS, and that he would invade Syria and block their oil to defeat ISIS.

When asked how he&#8217;d solve the education problem, he targets African-American youths, connects the problem to Obama, and blames America&#8217;s education problem on black people.

Oh, and he wants to build a wall from San Diego to Brownsville (and Mexico would day for it), tax China for their products entering the States, and openly oppose women running in politics.

I have a strong feeling that Trump looked up American politics on Wikipedia for two hours before deciding to run for president.
