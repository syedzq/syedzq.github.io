Huge changes at Google HQ this week.

> Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called Alphabet. I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President.

> What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and Calico (focused on longevity). Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related. 

Here's the main info: Alphabet is now Google's parent company, comprising Google and many more (mostly experimental) companies. Companies like Nest and Calico are under Alphabet, but YouTube and Android are still Google products.

Larry and Sergey are now CEO and President of Alphabet respectively and — you guessed it — Sundar Pichai is CEO of Google. Great and obvious choice.
