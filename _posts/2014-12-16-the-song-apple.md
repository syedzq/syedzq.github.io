A lot of people found this less moving than last year&#8217;s [&#8220;Misunderstood&#8221;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhwhnEe7CjE), but it still focuses on the same themes &#8211; when last year&#8217;s Emmy-winning commercial is taken out of the picture, this ad isn&#8217;t about Apple products or how these devices work together, but what really matters this holiday season &#8211; family and relationships.
