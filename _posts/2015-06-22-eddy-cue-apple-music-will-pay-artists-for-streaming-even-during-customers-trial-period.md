Good job, Taylor. Looks like Apple reconsidered their decision — they are now paying artists during the initial three-month trial period for Apple Music.

This change is significant — not very long ago, Apple wouldn&#8217;t shift their stance, showing that Tim Cook&#8217;s Apple may be more open. After [Phil Schiller&#8217;s interview on _The Talk Show_](http://zaidsyed.com/2015/06/10/phil-schiller-on-grubers-the-talk-show/), and [Cook&#8217;s interview with Mashable](http://zaidsyed.com/2015/06/08/mashable-interviews-tim-cook/), it looks like Apple of old is long gone.

Not only is this a significant win for artists, but also for the music industry in general.

Now, let&#8217;s see if Swift wants _1989_ on Apple Music.
