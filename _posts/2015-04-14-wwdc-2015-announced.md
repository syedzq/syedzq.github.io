Apple has returned to the &#8216;lottery&#8217; where you submit applications<sup id="fnref-836-1"><a href="#fn-836-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and get picked randomly — I think.

There&#8217;s also scholarship available for students and members of STEM organizations. I&#8217;m not yet eligible for the scholarship yet as an upcoming app has not been released into the App Store, and I won&#8217;t be done anytime near April 22. So I won&#8217;t be able to get into WWDC for free until next year, when I&#8217;m 16, assuming I make a killer app, which is really hard even at this age.

  I know we&#8217;re all <em>application</em> developers, but I mean applications. You know, the non-software kind?&#160;<a href="#fnref-836-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
