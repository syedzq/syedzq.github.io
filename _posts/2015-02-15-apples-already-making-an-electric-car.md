Apparently there&#8217;s already a team of up to a thousand people, and Tim Cook&#8217;s approved &#8220;Project Titan&#8221;. I can&#8217;t, and it seems like a [lot of people](https://twitter.com/ismh/status/566373165522120704) feel that they probably shouldn&#8217;t go for something like this while they&#8217;re preparing for probably their toughest year yet – they&#8217;ve already got OS X and iOS bugs to fix, as well as the looming Apple Watch release. A sane person would think they&#8217;ve got their plate full already.
