Myke Hurley and Stephen Hackett launched [Relay FM](http://relay.fm) back in 2014, and now have completely transformed independent podcasting. Their new series, Inquisitive&#8217;s Behind the App, has a production quality that rivals that of [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org). It&#8217;s well-researched, and the first episode features interviews with developers such as Greg Pierce of [Agile Tortoise](http://agiletortoise.com) and [Marco Arment](http://marco.org), developer of [Overcast](http://overcast.fm) and founder of [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com).

I loved the first episode, and can&#8217;t wait for the next one.
