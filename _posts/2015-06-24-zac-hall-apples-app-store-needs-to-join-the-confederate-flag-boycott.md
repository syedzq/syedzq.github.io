Interesting opinion by Zac Hall for _9to5Mac_.

> [&#8230;] a quick search on the App Store for ‘Confederate’ reveals iconography and artwork that displays exactly the symbol that Tim Cook spoke against on Sunday. One app, a game called Redneck Shooting Range, displays the flag behind a rifle scope. Another app, Southern Pride Themes, promotes the Confederate flag as an iPhone wallpaper.
> 
> I don’t believe Apple should censor historical content or remove informational material from iTunes or the App Store, but if a user wants to use the Confederate flag as a wallpaper, let them rely on an online image search and not an App Store app for creating that experience.
> 
> Apple controls the experience that customers have in its App Store in many controversial ways. Removing content that celebrates the Confederate flag should not be viewed as such. 

Some are historic — games about the Civil War, for example, may exhibit no racial bias at all, but some apps are clearly pro-Confederacy. I bet &#8220;Redneck Dictionary&#8221; may contain a few unfavorable words.
