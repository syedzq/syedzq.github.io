On the [Apple Watch Health & Fitness minisite](http://www.apple.com/watch/health-and-fitness/):

> Apple Watch is splash and water resistant but not waterproof. You can, for example, wear and use Apple Watch during exercise, in the rain, and while washing your hands, but submerging Apple Watch is not recommended. Apple Watch has a water resistance rating of IPX7 under IEC standard 60529. The leather bands are not water resistant. 

John Gruber pointed out that IPX7 is &#8220;1 meter of submersion for up to 30 minutes&#8221;, which is really amazing and much better than I suspected. This means you can easily take it into showers.
