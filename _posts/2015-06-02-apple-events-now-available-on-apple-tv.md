> Apple has today made their &#8216;Apple Events&#8217; channel accessible again from any Apple TV (2nd or 3rd generation), ahead of next week&#8217;s WWDC 2015 keynote. The Apple Events channel confirms that the keynote will be live-streamed on Monday, June 8 at 10am, San F[r]ancisco time.
> 
> For developers who want to follow along with the other WWDC sessions, Apple previously announced that &#8216;select&#8217; WWDC 2015 sessions will be live streamed on the WWDC website and in the WWDC app. For those technical sessions that are not live streamed, Apple has said that they will be made available to stream and download at the end of each day. 

I have no idea how I&#8217;ll do coverage of this, but I&#8217;m excited anyway.
