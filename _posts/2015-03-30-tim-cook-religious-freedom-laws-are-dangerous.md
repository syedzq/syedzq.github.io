Tim Cook, in a daring op-ed column for the [Washington Post](http://http://www.washingtonpost.com/ "Washington Post"):

> There’s something very dangerous happening in states across the country.
> 
> A wave of legislation, introduced in more than two dozen states, would allow people to discriminate against their neighbors. Some, such as the bill enacted in Indiana last week that drew a national outcry and one passed in Arkansas, say individuals can cite their personal religious beliefs to refuse service to a customer or resist a state nondiscrimination law. 

This comes as a reply to Indiana&#8217;s &#8216;Religious Freedom Restoration Act&#8217; that allows businesses to cite religious reasons for turning away certain groups, which was signed last week. In his piece, Cook explains why this move is a risky move on part of Republican Indiana governor.

Cook ends:

> This isn’t a political issue. It isn’t a religious issue. This is about how we treat each other as human beings. Opposing discrimination takes courage. With the lives and dignity of so many people at stake, it’s time for all of us to be courageous.
