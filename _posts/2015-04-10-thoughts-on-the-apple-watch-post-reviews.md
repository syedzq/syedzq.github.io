As has been said many times before, the fate of the Apple Watch holds a lot. The Watch is the first new product line since the death of Steve Jobs. It’s the first product line under the leadership of Tim Cook and under the control of Jony Ive. It’s the first product line under the ‘new’ Apple.

The Watch carries more weight than any other product. It’s the answer to skeptic’s questions about Apple’s leadership. The Apple Watch is portrayed as Tim Cook’s own brainchild, honed over many years to show that Cook is in fact, _not_ leading Apple into oblivion. That means that the success of the Apple Watch is being used to judge the effectiveness of Tim Cook’s leadership, or rather how ‘visionary’ he is. And that’s perfectly fine. But what’s concerning is when reviews came out on Thursday, the Watch — and to an extent, Cook — was being just by a far harsher question: Do you _need_ the Apple Watch?

A few highly regarded journalists, such as _The Verge_’s Nilay Patel have expressed their disappointment at the Apple Watch, as they felt that they did not ‘need’ it. Patel writes:

> That’s the real question of the Apple Watch. Does it offer so much to you that you’re willing to deal with the hassles and idiosyncrasies of a new platform that is clearly still finding a true purpose? 

These thoughts communicate a sense of need with the Watch. But those beliefs are rather unfounded. The Watch is a _luxury_, and it’s marketed by Apple as one. From the very start at the September 2014 event at the Flint Center, Apple introduced the Watch as a ‘natural extension’ of your iPhone, and a ‘great accessory’ to the iPhone. If you look behind the marketing terms, Apple’s clearly hinting that the Watch is a luxury.

Similarly, the Wall Street Journal also muses about the status of the Watch in the Apple ecosystem:

> Do I really need another connected screen blinking, beeping and buzzing all day? 

Despite the majority of reviews being positive, the number of negative reviews were clearly surprising to many. But it’s rather evocative of the initial reception the iPhone received.

With full credit to [Jim Dalrymple], here are the some of the negative reviews the original iPhone received back in 2007.

CNET’s Michael Kanellos:

> “Apple is slated to come out with a new phone… And it will largely fail…. Sales for the phone will skyrocket initially. However, things will calm down, and the Apple phone will take its place on the shelves with the random video cameras, cell phones, wireless routers and other would-be hits… When the iPod emerged in late 2001, it solved some major problems with MP3 players. Unfortunately for Apple, problems like that don’t exist in the handset business. Cell phones aren’t clunky, inadequate devices. Instead, they are pretty good. Really good.” 

Bloomberg’s Matthew Lynn:

> “The iPhone is nothing more than a luxury bauble that will appeal to a few gadget freaks. In terms of its impact on the industry, the iPhone is less relevant… Apple is unlikely to make much of an impact on this market… Apple will sell a few to its fans, but the iPhone won’t make a long-term mark on the industry.” 

Indeed, this is the trend with most Apple products. Negative reception from the press initially, but widespread popularity and worldwide attention and hype.

Now, to address what appears to be the shared opinions of the reviewers across the board.

Battery life — despite [earlier being a concern] — was praised heavily, with many reviewers noting around 20-30% remaining at the end of a day with moderate to heavy usage. I particularly enjoyed John Gruber’s assessment of battery life on the Apple Watch. Gruber writes: 

> After more than a week of daily use, Apple Watch has more than alleviated any concerns I had about getting through a day on a single charge. I noted the remaining charge when I went to bed each night. It was usually still in the 30s or 40s. Once it was still over 50 percent charged. Once, it was down to 27. And one day — last Thursday — it was all the way down to 5 percent. But that day was an exception — I used the watch for an extraordinary amount of testing, nothing at all resembling typical usage. I’m surprised the watch had any remaining charge at all that day. I never once charged the watch other than while I slept. 

Of course, compared to a ‘normal’ analog watch, that kind of battery life is terrible. But for a smartwatch with a color display, that’s amazing.

Also praised was the Taptic Engine and Force Touch.

By far the least well-received was the notification frequency. There was no control of notifications on a per-app basis, so you could either turn it off, or one, but you couldn’t prioritize, say a Twitter direct mention or a follow recommendation reminder.

While it’s unlikely I’ll be getting an Apple Watch, my ideal model would be the Space Black Stainless Steel case with the Space Black Link Bracelet, although a more realistic option financially would be the Space Gray Aluminum case with the Black Sports Band.
