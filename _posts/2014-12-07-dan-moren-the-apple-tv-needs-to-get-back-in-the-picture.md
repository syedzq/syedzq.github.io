> And though the company’s always been a little bit cagey about its plans for the living room—the Apple TV was a “hobby” and then “an area of intense interest”—there’s little doubt in my mind that Apple wants a foothold there just as much as it does in your car or on your wrist. 

Also, by Tim Cook’s own admission, the Apple TV had outgrown the “hobby” categorization. He mentioned this in the [Charlie Rose interview](http://www.hulu.com/watch/686851) from a while back, so it’s safe to assume that (substantial) changes may come in 2015.

Apple may yet again be late to the market, but I’m counting on them to make something that’s truly a game-changer.

But first, Apple will need to focus on the Apple Watch.
