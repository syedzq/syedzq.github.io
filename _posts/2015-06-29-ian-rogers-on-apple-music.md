Ian Rogers, in charge of Apple Music, on his blog:

> In 1993 I was a Computer Science student at Indiana University when Dr Fenske gave me an opportunity to put my studies together with my love, music. He set me off writing an app on NeXTSTEP to stream music (wav) from one part of the campus to another (thanks Rob Francis). I’ve been streaming music ever since. From posting MP3 files immediately after the show in 1998 (thanks Mike, Adam, Adam, John, Bethann) to Winamp, SHOUTcast Radio, Gnutella, and Waste (thanks Rob, Justin, Tom, Steve) to Muse.Net to building and releasing the first ever $5/month music subscription service (thanks Dave and Bob). From walking Capitol Hill post CRB ruling to sitting on the stand in White Plains all in defense of streaming radio. Add to that endless Topspin stump speeches about giving artists direct access to the people who love their art (thanks Shamal, Peter) and more recently building and releasing a human-curated, music-respecting service, Beats Music (thanks Luke, Jimmy, Trent, Dre). 

And a little reminder:

> Tuesday morning we’ll be unveiling the next chapter. Please make a note to upgrade to iOS 8.4 Tuesday, June 30th and listen to our first day of broadcasting. Here’s a Facebook invite to make it easy for you to say yes, you’ll be there, and invite all your friends. See you there.
