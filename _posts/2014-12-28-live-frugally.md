> I&#8217;m not a hardcore minimalist, but this small space I&#8217;ve lived in for 4 years has kept my life pretty simple. And this simpler life is much more aligned with my environmental values — small living means a smaller carbon footprint. You end up thinking carefully about what you buy or bring into your life when, for instance, acquiring a new pair of shoes means you have to get rid of a pair you already own in order to fit them in the closet. 

It seems like an interesting challenge. Would someone actually be happier living simpler?
