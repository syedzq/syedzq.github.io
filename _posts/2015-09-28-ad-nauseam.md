Samantha Bielefeld, writing on her [eponymous site](http://samanthabielefeld.com):

> I completely agree with The Deck employing a flat rate fee for advertisers, and a set amount for site owners. It eliminates the incentive to falsify results. The Deck is able to hand-pick the types of products and services that are displayed because they know full well the audience they&#8217;re speaking to. They have been able to prove that you can provide meaningful, targeted ads without being creepy. Unfortunately, I feel we have reached a point where it really doesn&#8217;t matter how well respected you feel by The Deck Network&#8217;s ad implementation. Using an app like Crystal will become the norm and the existing user base that whitelists sites will be marginally more than what exists now. The potential for a growth in ad impressions on iOS will soon only be occurring in Apple News.

> My fear is in why Apple decided to launch content blockers (which would overwhelmingly be used for ad blocking) at the same time as News.app. They are replicating a feature of the web, stripping out any custom design the originating website may have employed, and then controlling the payout to publishers. Signaling that Safari provides for a horrible reading experience, and that Apple can provide a solution to the user angst. The ad networks have become so bad that they have created a new market for Apple to dominate. Now if only Apple had more carefully considered the implications of trying to manage an industry like this, and the degree to which writers covet the even playing field the Internet allows for. 

My views align with her. While I haven&#8217;t seen anyone I know use Apple News, I know that content blockers are _hot_, even amongst those not &#8216;into&#8217; tech at all. That said, Apple is trying to App Store-ify online journalism. It&#8217;s not really &#8216;free&#8217; anymore — web publishers have to play into either Google, Facebook, Twitter or Apple&#8217;s hands in order to survive. And that does _not_ seem good for the industry.
