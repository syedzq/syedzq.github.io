Today&#8217;s Apple event will probably be the busiest of _any_ of the past few Apple events, including June&#8217;s 160-minute presentation at WWDC.

What does everyone expect Apple will talk about?

At this moment, we&#8217;ve got:

  1. **iPhone 6s and 6s Plus** — there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any news regarding the 6c.
  2. **A completely reinvented Apple TV.** Featuring a new UI, new hardware, and a better remote, and most importantly, a whole new _platform_.
  3. **Apple Watch**. I expect that, since iOS 9 (and its GM) will be demoed today with the iPhones, there&#8217;s no reason not to expect the same to happen with the Apple Watch, especially since, as [Gruber points out](http://daringfireball.net/2015/09/prelude_to_hey_siri_event), it&#8217;s heading into its first holiday quarter.
  4. **iPad Pro.** We&#8217;ve gotten really chock-full already. I&#8217;m standing by two events this fall.

Now, the nature and tone of the past few events — starting with last year&#8217;s September event, with so much to talk about, events have become more and more rushed — remember when Tim Cook used to give you an update on Apple Retail, sales, App Store revenue, etc.? Well, all that&#8217;s gone, saved most likely for press releases and the stock earnings calls they hold separately.

Here&#8217;s what I expect, in terms of timing.

Within ten minutes of the event starting, we&#8217;ll get introduced to the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus. Tim Cook will introduce the event, and start off with iPhone — he&#8217;ll most likely play an introductory video, then hand it off to Phil Schiller to explain the new features/improvements/enhancements. Something I definitely expect will be a Force Touch demonstration with an app — maybe it&#8217;s a graphics app like [Pixelmator](http://pixelmator.com) or perhaps a game, but I think the game aspect will be reserved for the Apple TV. I expect the iPhone segment of the keynote to last around half an hour to forty-five minutes, including demonstrations. We&#8217;ll also definitely see it make an appearance during the demos for other products — most likely to show off the integration between the Apple Watch (with watchOS 2).

Apple Event, Act II: Apple Watch. Other than the purported new bands, I don&#8217;t expect Apple to add anything new on the accessories/hardware side, but I expect a full-blown demonstration involving iPhone 6s, Apple Watch, and watchOS 2 — this segment of the keynote will perhaps last about twenty to thirty minutes, since there&#8217;s not that much material to go through. One thing to expect: showing off third-party complications, perhaps with HomeKit integration. I don&#8217;t think a third-party developer will present it though.

&#8216;One more thing&#8217;, part one: iPad Pro. An Apple Watch-esque presentation for today. That means an introduction, with a quick demo involving Apple Pen, the Force Touch display, and third-party apps that suit the Pro. Perhaps half an hour, but I don&#8217;t expect it to be thorough in the least. I think an October event is still in the running, where the Pro will be explained in depth, like the March event was for the Apple Watch. The October event will probably also have updates to OS X and Macs, and regular normal-sized iPad refreshes. As for today: I think the iPad Pro will be introduced, demoed for a while, but nothing that&#8217;s too in-depth. I could be wrong.

&#8216;One more thing&#8217;, part two: Apple TV. I expect a normal, complete presentation. That means the initial introduction, perhaps in video form, presented by Tim Cook, with cameos from industry executives — perhaps from HBO or some other media company, as well as game developers that the Apple TV will have some ties to. This part of the presentation will take _at least_ an hour, with the product introduction to, well, _everything_, as well as demonstrations from Apple about the UI and experience, gaming from leading game developers, [apparently Periscope](http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/periscope-apple-tv/), as well as &#8216;Hollywood people&#8217;. I expect this to be _the_ main segment of the entire event.

Looking at this summary, the whole event looks to exceed two and a half hours at most, so I doubt there&#8217;s enough time for anything beyond that that isn&#8217;t a _must_. An October event _must_ happen.
