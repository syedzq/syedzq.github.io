Serial Periscoper Andrew has a great step-by-step guide on how to save Periscopes. Periscope already has this feature, but only stores it for 24 hours. In this way, you can record a stream with comments, too.

I&#8217;ve tried this out in the past with [Ãšll talks](http://2015.ull.ie), but this is the first blog post I&#8217;ve seen about it. It works with any iOS device with a Lightning connector<sup id="fnref-974-1"><a href="#fn-974-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and any Mac running Yosemite.
