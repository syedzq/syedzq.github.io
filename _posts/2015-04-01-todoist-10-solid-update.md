From Signore Viticci&#8217;s excellent review of Todoist for iOS&#8217; latest update:

> Todoist 10 doesn&#8217;t have a list of hundreds of new features and changes, but the major additions it brings are laying the groundwork for the app&#8217;s next steps on iOS and Apple Watch. Intelligent input, gestures, and visual customization are going to be some of the app&#8217;s pillars going forward, and I believe Todoist has chosen the right functionalities to build upon. 

Ever since reading Viticci&#8217;s [original article covering his switch to Todoist](http://www.macstories.net/stories/why-i-left-icloud-reminders-for-todoist/), I&#8217;ve used Todoist daily, and I&#8217;m glad to see some of the new features introduced today.

While it&#8217;s definitely worth reading the full review, here&#8217;s a summary of the main new features Todoist brought to its iOS app:

#### A New UI

A UI revision introduces themes, more icons over text labels, and bit of UI enhancement to make sure you can get where you want faster.

#### Natural Language Input, and Faster Task Creation

Todoist 10 brings Fantastical-style natural language parsing for task creation, so you can input a task type, date and repeat, and Todoist parses even the most complex types of deadlines. Instead of opening an advanced task creation screen, instead it opens a Messages-esque input bar for natural language input.

#### Gesture Support and Bulk Editing

Before, Todoist only allowed you to swipe from the right to complete a task — deleting was far more advanced; you had to go into yet _another_ screen to remove a task. Now, there are many more gestures you can take advantage of.

The latest version of Todoist brings enhancements that make sure you save time in Todoist — faster task creation, natural language input, UI enhancements and gesture support make sure you can quickly add a task and leave, allowing you to save time actually _doing_ those tasks.

(Not an April Fools prank).
