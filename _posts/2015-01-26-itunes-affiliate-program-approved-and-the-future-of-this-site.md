I applied for the iTunes Affiliate Program last week. Today, I received a reply, accepting me into the program. This means that if I link to an app or any other iTunes content I like, I&#8217;ll get a small kickback. It&#8217;s a joy for anyone to earn money for what they love doing, and this is no different. Starting today, every time I link to iTunes content, I&#8217;ll earn a bit of money.

This doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ll rush to link some new app everyday. If I _really_ like something on iTunes, I&#8217;ll link to it. A handy script then converts normal iTunes links into affiliate links, which then means that if you decide to purchase the app, I&#8217;ll get a bit of money.

Of course, this is great for me. The money I get from this allows me to supplement my family&#8217;s income. But this won&#8217;t mean the quality of this site (depending on what you make it to be) will decline. I&#8217;ll still work on producing my best work for this site.

That said, I&#8217;m updating my [colophon](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/about "About - Command-Z") (now called &#8220;About&#8221;) to include this little disclaimer.

Which leads me on to another point: I also sometimes get promo codes and beta-testing opportunities for certain products. If I like these apps, and think that the people who read this site will like them, I&#8217;ll write a review. But my reviews will never be biased because I get the product for free forever or for a certain time. I&#8217;ll still take my time to write something that&#8217;s truthful. Examples of this is my review of [Typed](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2014/12/10/a-typed-review/) and the short post about [GA.TODAY](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2015/01/12/ga-today-google-analytics-in-the-today-view/).

### The Future of This Site

I want to write this blog forever. It&#8217;s something I _really_ want to do. I&#8217;m passionate about technology, design, and writing (apparent by the use of the Oxford comma). Soon, I&#8217;ll spin this blog out into its own domain, cmd-z.net. When I first started this blog, I named it Command-Z, and I have no idea why, but it just stuck. It&#8217;s a bit arbitrary for Command-Z to be hosted on a domain like [zaidsyed.com/blog](http://zaidsyed.com/blog), and I think soon it&#8217;s time for a change. I haven&#8217;t purchased cmd-z.net yet or anything, but I hope it stays vacant, because there are a lot of sites named Command-Z. My main site, [zaidsyed.com](http://zaidsyed.com) will likely serve as a portfolio to my creative work as a web and graphic designer, and more recently, [app development](http://sis.zaidsyed.com).

I also recently applied for Google AdSense. This means that this blog will probably soon have an ad. I know exactly where it&#8217;s going to go – below the sidebar, and that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t want my blog to become one of those sites infested with ugly ads, but AdSense is the de facto ad network for small blogs. Until this site grows enough to make its way to one of the better ad networks, I&#8217;m stuck with AdSense. But right now, ads aren&#8217;t something I&#8217;m chasing after, it&#8217;s content. If I try out AdSense and find that its ads are as bad as they look, I&#8217;ll probably take them off the site, no matter how much money I&#8217;ve earned from it. That&#8217;s my roadmap for this site. It&#8217;s not something very detailed, and the domain transfer and AdSense are the only two things I can see upcoming so far. For now, I&#8217;m dedicated to publishing my best writing on this site.
