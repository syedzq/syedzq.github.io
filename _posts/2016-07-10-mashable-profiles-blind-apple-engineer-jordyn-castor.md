Mashable&#8217;s Katie Dupere wrote an invigorating profile about Jordyn Castor, a software engineer at Apple who happens to be blind. She currently works on enhancing VoiceOver for blind users.

> At that job fair in 2015, Castor&#8217;s passion for accessibility and Apple was evident. She was soon hired as an intern focusing on VoiceOver accessibility.
> 
> As her internship came to a close, Castor&#8217;s skills as an engineer and advocate for tech accessibility were too commanding to let go. She was hired full-time as an engineer on the accessibility design and quality team â€” a group of people Castor describes as &#8220;passionate&#8221; and &#8220;dedicated.&#8221;

> &#8220;I&#8217;m directly impacting the lives of the blind community,&#8221; she says of her work. &#8220;It&#8217;s incredible.&#8221; 

For all Apple claims to be changing the world, it&#8217;s nice to see hard-hitting proof of the commitment of Apple employees to impact the lives of their customers. It&#8217;s long been evident that Apple has been influential in making their products accessible for others, to a degree much effective than any other large company in the valley.

It&#8217;s important to remember that diversity goes far, far beyond race, gender, and sexuality, and includes people with a variety of experiences. These people&#8217;s individuality (in this case Jordyn Castor) brings novel and newfound solutions to problems. Castor&#8217;s insight of what it&#8217;s like living as a blind person lends Apple&#8217;s a lifetime&#8217;s worth of unique experiences to be able to put forth into designing great software for some of their most ardent consumers.
