Manson Reece writes a wonderful piece on [his blog](http://www.manton.org/2015/10/a-great-developer-can-come-from-anywhere.html):

> It’s March 2009, the height of SXSW in Austin before the conference gets too big for itself. I’m hanging out downtown with tech folks from a blogging startup, having dinner and beers before we head to the party they’re putting on. The CTO, one of the first employees at the company, is talking about Memcache servers and MySQL scaling, and I’m hanging on every word. I love this stuff. [&#8230;]
> 
> We walk over to the party venue. It’s bigger and more crowded than he thought it would be. Their company has really taken off, growing well beyond the early days when it was just him and the founder trying to build something new. And it’s at this point that he turns to me and asks a question that brings us back to iOS development:
    
> 
    
> “So what do you think of my app, Instapaper?”
    
> 
    
> In answer to Marco Arment, at that time the CTO of Tumblr, I mutter something about liking it, but I haven’t really gotten it into my workflow yet. Hopefully whatever I said was encouraging. In subsequent years, of course, Instapaper would be one of my favorite apps. 

This is such a strong piece. The main point Manton is trying to get across is that developers shouldn&#8217;t be jealous of another, but rather, _inspired_ by them.

> I’ll never accept the implied negativity in the “that’s fine for Marco” argument. I’ll never accept that we should be jealous of another developer’s success instead of inspired by it to do our best work.
