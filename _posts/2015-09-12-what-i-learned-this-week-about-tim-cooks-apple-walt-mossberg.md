Walt Mossberg published his opinions on this week&#8217;s Apple event on [The Verge](http://theverge.com), as part of a new monthly column by Mossberg called simply, &#8220;Mossberg&#8221;.

While the piece is very interesting, what this means for Mossberg and The Verge is also interesting: The Verge pulls in a lot more traffic compared to [Recode](http://recode.net), Mossberg&#8217;s own tech site. Having his own column on The Verge introduced readers to Recode, while The Verge gets a star writer for their site. It&#8217;s a win-win situation.
