After literally _months_ of work, I&#8217;m finally ready to launch a project I&#8217;ve been working on: [Discourse](http://itunes.discoursepodcast.com), an interview podcast about the story behind influential people.

I discovered podcasts three years ago, and have continued to be fascinated by the various formats and styles of podcasts that are possible within this medium, whether they&#8217;re interview podcasts like [The Tim Ferriss Show](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/), fascinating storytelling like [Lore](http://lorepodcast.com), game shows like [Ciquizza](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ciquizza-the-fix-podcast/id1148632301?mt=2), or the ubiquitous general discussion podcast, there is no shortage of shapes and sizes podcasts can take. It&#8217;s the former two formats I became interested in: interviews, and storytelling. While they tend to remain separate formats, what would a podcast look like if it tried to combine both? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to do in Discourse.

In late August, I recorded the first episode, in which I interviewed Jeremy Rossmann, MIT drop-out and the founder of [Make School](https://www.makeschool.com), a college alternative for software developers, but I finished editing in late September as I learned the ins and outs of podcast editing and marketing. Since then, I&#8217;ve stared at the finished .mp3 file sitting on my desktop, asking myself when I was going the take the next step and release it into the wild. Well, I guess the guilt got to me, so here we are.

You can listen to episode 1 of Discourse now on [iTunes](http://itunes.discoursepodcast.com) or [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/itunes1161756448/discourse). Discourse does not have any sponsors at the moment. If you&#8217;d like to support the show, you can sign up to be a patron on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/syed), where you can send in your own (approved) questions to pre-announced guests for as little as $5 per month.

I&#8217;d like to thank my family, [Harshil Shah](https://twitter.com/harshilshah1910), [Matt Birchler](https://twitter.com/mattbirchler), [Michael Rockwell](https://twitter.com/mdrockwell), and [Aniket Sharma](http://twitter.com/SharmajiDaBeta) for their feedback and support.
