Field Notes just announced their Fall 2015 edition memo book. It&#8217;s themed after Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, and it&#8217;s beautiful, with wonderful colors. The front cover color is different to the back cover one, and they achieved it through a process called duplexing.

> If you want paper that’s one color on one side and another color on the reverse, the simplest thing to do is to start with white paper and print a different ink on each side. We’ve done that, it’s simple, it works well. But we’re Field Notes; if there’s a more difficult, expensive, and awesome way to achieve the same result, we will find it. In this case, it’s called duplexing. Using brute force and adhesives, you take two different colored papers and fuse them together so that they become one. We’ve used duplex paper before (in our “American Tradesman” and “Raven’s Wing” editions) but this time we had specific paper and colors in mind, and an off-the-shelf solution wouldn’t work. So for the very first time, we made our own.
