Fraser Speirs, writing on his [blog](http://speirs.org):

> I see the iPad Pro not so much as a laptop replacement for anyone who has invested 20+ years in being a laptop user. No, the iPad Pro is the &#8220;laptop&#8221; for people who, today, are 12-16 years old who will graduate from High School in the next few years and look for the next-level iOS device to take them to college and beyond into a career. 

Speirs&#8217; analysis of the iPad Pro is excellent, and this piece is a great read. My views are similar to his in that, the people my age will go on to use the iPad Pro as their everyday work device. Today, that&#8217;s the MacBook Air â€” many use the Air for just emails, Word documents and presentations. Speirs argues that these devices will be replaced by the iPad Pro in the next generation.
