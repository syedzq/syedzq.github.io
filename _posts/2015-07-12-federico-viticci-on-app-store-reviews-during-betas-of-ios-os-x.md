Federico Viticci, writing for [MacStories](http://macstories.net):

> Developers can&#8217;t submit app updates with official support for iOS 9 and El Capitan yet. It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re lazy, or they don&#8217;t want to â€“ they can&#8217;t because the App Store can&#8217;t accept software built with iOS 9 and El Capitan features yet. This happens every year: Apple typically opens submissions for apps with support for the latest versions of iOS and OS X a week or two before the release of the new OSes, but until that time third-party apps on the App Store are limited to the current, shipping version of iOS and OS X. This makes sense on Apple&#8217;s part: because those operating systems aren&#8217;t finished and millions of customers aren&#8217;t running them yet, the App Store has to wait for the official release of the new iOS and OS X.

It&#8217;s great to have a voice of authority like Federico on this issue. People who are running iOS and OS X betas and leaving App Store reviews: the public beta isn&#8217;t an opportunity to give one-star reviews of a third-party app. Developers can&#8217;t do anything about it. It&#8217;s best to let them know privately rather than publicly criticizing their app for not releasing an update for unreleased operating systems.
