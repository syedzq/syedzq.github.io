Finally, a good unboxing video, available in glorious 4K definition.

In all seriousness, I find the choice of packaging interesting. With Apple Watch, a cubic box is used, with a compact and beautiful (plastic) storage case, not dissimilar to a jewelry box. Inside, the Watch is fitted with another strap to keep the round shape. Apple wants you to know the difference in the unboxing.

The Sport collection, on the other hand, has a very basic long and rectangular box similar to other modern, cheap watches. It&#8217;s spread out, not curved in the box. While not premium, it&#8217;s still a very exciting unboxing experience.

In [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ8gCM5NudI) (this one from April 11), we get to see what may be the Apple Watch Edition boxes. We&#8217;ll never know for now, as I couldn&#8217;t find any other unboxing videos.
