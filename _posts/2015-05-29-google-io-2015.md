Here&#8217;s my summary of Google I/O:

## Android M

A quick note: Android fragmentation is terrible. Just a while ago a friend&#8217;s S5 got updated to Lollipop, so the news of Android M really caught me out. Android M doesn&#8217;t seem like much of a big update, when compared with last year&#8217;s update:

  * App permissions updates
  * &#8220;Improved app links&#8221;
  * [Android Pay](http://venturebeat.com/2015/05/28/google-unveils-android-pay-its-apple-pay-competitor/) &#8211; I thought [Samsung Pay](http://money.cnn.com/infographic/technology/mobile-payment-comparison/) was bad enough at shamelessly ripping off both products _and_ product names, but looks like Google&#8217;s doing it too. Android Pay has a similar lineup of retailers, such as McDonalds, Panera Bread, etc. I&#8217;m guessing they want a repeat of Apple Pay, but I doubt Android Pay is going to take off as much — once again, I think fragmentation means that the Android Pay hype will come in waves when every single unique type of device on different carriers receive their update.
  * Support for fingerprint sensors — a little less than two years after the iPhone 5S shipped with the first mainstream smartphone fingerprint sensor, Android M has officially started supporting fingerprint sensors.

## Chrome Joins the Three Comma Club

Google Chrome now has over 1 billion users, according to Google, joining the 1 billion club with Android (another huge ecosystem), YouTube, Google Maps and Gmail.

## Google Photos

I downloaded this app as soon as I could get my hands on it. I&#8217;m going to do some separate coverage of this, so stay tuned. Here&#8217;s a [link](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8678629/google-photos-app-announced) to the [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com) recap.

## Google Now On Demand with &#8220;Now on tap&#8221;

[Basically a version of Google Now available to launch from any other app without opening a new UI, kinda like Siri.](http://insidesearch.blogspot.hk/2015/05/now-on-tap.html)

## Google Inbox Updates

Now free for everyone to use, except Google Apps users. _Ugh_. I&#8217;m happy with [Mailbox](http://mailboxapp.com) for now. Also new: bundling together emails about trips with added Google Now cards, and swipe-right to delete. Not switching from Mailbox, though. Also neat is the Undo Send feature from Gmail.
