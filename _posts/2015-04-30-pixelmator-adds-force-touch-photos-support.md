A simply great update to Pixelmator&#8217;s OS X app. Although the version number (3.3.2) may make it sound incremental (bug fixes and the like), it adds a variety of improvements and new features, such as Force Touch support with the new MacBook and the 13&#8243; MacBook Pros.

Also welcome is Photos for OS X support and a brand new Repair Tool. Pixelmator is one of my most-used apps, I love it.

Pixelmator is available on the [Mac App Store for $29.99](https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/pixelmator/id407963104).
