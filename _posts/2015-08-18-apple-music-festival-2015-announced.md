iTunes Festival has been renamed to &#8220;Apple Music Festival&#8221; after the launch of the service back in June 30.

> “We wanted to do something really special for music fans this year,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “The Apple Music Festival is a greatest hits set of ten unbelievable nights featuring some of the best performers on the planet appearing live and interacting directly with their fans on Connect and Beats 1.” 

The Apple Music Festival starts on September 19 and ends September 28.
