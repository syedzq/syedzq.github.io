It&#8217;s been three weeks since the New Year, and I&#8217;m already having trouble sticking to my resolution.

It&#8217;s simple enough on paper: _Do not procrastinate._

Unfortunately, as my peers know, Procrastination is that good friend who, in a well-meaning way, is an annoyance you _have_ to go along with. It&#8217;s accurate to say I pretty much flunked that resolution in the first week of school.

Not soon after, I met another friend who you always run into: stress. Homework piled up &#8211; essays to write, graphs to draw, exercises to do. I realized too late that my resolution wasn&#8217;t at fault – it was the way I executed my resolution that was wrong. I planned ahead for _due dates_, which meant the slightest change in schedule &#8211; a phone call, an urgent meeting &#8211; would screw up my entire system for schoolwork. The app I was using &#8211; [myHomework](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myhomework/id303490844) by Rodrigo Neri &#8211; alerted me three days before the due date of the particular task. Procrastination told me I had three days left. And it&#8217;s an easy piece of homework, so I can probably do it tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or even the morning it&#8217;s due &#8211; I can&#8217;t count how many times I&#8217;ve done homework before leaving for school. I used myHomework because it was perfectly optimized for students.

For those uninitiated with what kind of parameters are required for homework, it&#8217;s usually a) a due date, b) a task name, c) notes or detailed information, and d) a **reminder date**. This ideology of setting a reminder date is flawed. It means that a student, instead of supplementing knowledge gained from that day&#8217;s class, is instead postponing it up to a week after that day. The student then has to struggle to remember what was taught the last time he or she had that class.

Homework exists to supplement learning in class to make sure students don&#8217;t forget material they have learned in class. And I realized I was doing it all wrong.

So I went back, and rethought my whole homework process. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do, from here on out. I&#8217;m going to complete homework the day it is given, the way homework is supposed to be done. I&#8217;m going to do homework when I&#8217;m still in &#8220;the zone&#8221;((You know, because I&#8217;ve just come back from school. Believe it or not, it can be tough to do homework later in the day.)), and not leave it for another week.

Here&#8217;s where Due 2 comes in. Due 2 has received lots of great feedback in the past few days, and it&#8217;s been about a week since it came out. I hadn&#8217;t even heard of Due before reading [Federico Viticci&#8217;s great review of it](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/due-2-review-effective-reminders/) last Thursday. It impressed me tremendously. It had a beautiful design, and is one of the few apps (alongside apps like Vesper) that used the [hamburger button](http://thehamburgerbutton.com) right.

And it fit my new homework ideology perfectly. Earlier on, I identified my criteria for a homework management app. Due fits practically none of that. But it fits my new philosophy completely. Now, I can remember homework, come straight home and do it. Now, in the place of various tasks in myHomework, I now have one reminder in Due: Homework, at 5:30 PM.

It&#8217;s the simplicity of Due that has enamored me. If my friend Procrastination makes a comeback, Due reminds me &#8211; every five minutes &#8211; that I should be doing homework. It&#8217;s the perfect system for me, and the type of person I am. Due 2 has helped me become a better student, and a better person. It&#8217;s not for managing long term projects. It&#8217;s for the things you want to do today, and everyday, but are easy to forget.

In the place of Procrastination, I feel like I&#8217;ve made a new friend. A better friend. A friend called Due.

_Due 2 is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/due-super-fast-reminders-reusable/id390017969?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) for $4.99._
