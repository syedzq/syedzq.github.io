John Paczkowski, reporting for BuzzFeed News:

> Sources in position to know tell BuzzFeed News that the 4th generation Apple TV will not initially support 4K video — a newer high-definition video resolution that delivers a more detailed, immersive picture. “4K is great, but it’s still in its infancy,” said one source familiar with Apple’s thinking. 

This makes sense, given that Apple typically waits for technology to mature before thinking about implementing it into their own ecosystems or products. 4K has been around for a while (and every CES seems to feature a 4K TV of some sort), it wouldn&#8217;t make sense from an Apple perspective to include 4K content into iTunes this soon. Not only do enough consumers not have 4K TVs to play the content, there is a lack of 4K content beyond a few Netflix shows and a few other content providers. Not to mention the lack of sufficient broadband for 4K streaming, especially in the United States.

In the same vein, Apple only introduced NFC to the iPhone last year, while Android devices introduced NFC in 2012, yet mobile payments only really took off with Apple Pay last year. This could either be because of the &#8220;Apple&#8221; effect<sup id="fnref-782-1"><a href="#fn-782-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, or just because it was finally the right time for mobile payments to happen. In the same vein, I expect Apple to wait until 4K content really takes off — along with 4K TVs hitting consumers and bandwidth to catch up before adding 4K content to iTunes.
