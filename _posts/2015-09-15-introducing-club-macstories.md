My favorite Apple blog, [MacStories](http://macstories.net) just launched their members program, Club MacStories. If you love MacStories, this is an awesome way to support MacStories _and_ get great content.

> Since 2009, MacStories has delivered quality articles for the Apple community with a focus on depth, accuracy, and personal stories. We&#8217;ve written thousands of detailed app reviews. We&#8217;ve covered news with facts and opinions. We&#8217;ve shared stories on how technology is changing our lives.
> 
> Now, we&#8217;re ready for the next step. Today, I&#8217;m thrilled to introduce Club MacStories. [&#8230;]
> 
> Club MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content, delivered every week. At $5/month or $50/year, our most loyal readers will be able to enjoy some great perks. 

Huge congratulations to Federico Viticci and team.
