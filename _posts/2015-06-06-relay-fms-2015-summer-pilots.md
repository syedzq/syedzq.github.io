Relay FM is bringing on even more podcasts, this time with two originals: _Cortex_ and _Reconcilable Differences_.

_Cortex_ features Myke Hurley and CGP Grey from _Hello Internet_, a dream come true for me. It&#8217;s essentially an extended Inquisitive episode spanning ten initial episodes, all about Grey&#8217;s setup.

_Reconcilable Differences_ is hosted by Merlin Mann and John Siracusa, another dream team. It&#8217;s about their backgrounds in tech and pop culture, and it&#8217;s a blast.
