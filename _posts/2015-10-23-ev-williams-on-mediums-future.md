Adam Popescu scored a great chat with Ev Williams for [The Verge](http://theverge.com), where Williams discusses Medium&#8217;s future, how it&#8217;s worked compared to the original vision, and how writers and readers can connect through Medium. The part that sticks out to me is this bit about the hole the Medium fills in social media:

> I started Medium with the intention that there’s a better way to support quality ideas, thinking, stories we don’t yet have on the internet. Social media filled a gap that we didn’t know existed before, and Twitter and its followers so-to-speak have created a layer of real-time information that is extremely powerful. But that doesn’t suffice to help explain our world, or drive deeper understanding and connection. The web itself wasn’t meeting that need to its full potential. That’s why we created Medium. 

I did feel like Medium solved a lot of problems we had before 2012. While some simply don&#8217;t &#8216;get&#8217; it, I think it&#8217;s a great way for people to express themselves. It&#8217;s a great platform that allows socializes longform text. A lot of people still love building up a blog, writing consistently until you attract readers — like myself. But I think a lot more people will gravitate toward Medium to get their voice heard today — it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s easier to surface content in the network that Medium has created for people who want to get heard.
