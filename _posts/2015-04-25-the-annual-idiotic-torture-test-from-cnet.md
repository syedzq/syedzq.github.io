CNET really turned up the heat on this one, possibly the most stupid of torture tests against gadgets I&#8217;ve seen in years.

The Apple Watch Sport fared well in almost all categories, ranging from &#8216;accidentally&#8217; dropping the Watch into water to dropping a 7-pound skillet on it. The Watch resisted all except the skillet, even functioning normally after being dropped &#8216;accidentally&#8217; into boiling water.

If the purpose behind torture tests are to simulate real-life dangers, why is dropping Nutella on an Apple Watch in this video?
