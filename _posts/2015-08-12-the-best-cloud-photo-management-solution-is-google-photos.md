> While Appleâ€™s iCloud Photos is really well-done and built right into OS X and iOS, I prefer Google Photos for my photo management solution. It allows me to keep my photos organized in the Finder, but gives me the flexibility of also having everything in a powerful cloud service. 

Great roundup by Bradley Chambers, showcasing the best cloud photo management solutions out there right now, and the best is Google Photos. When it came out last May, it was everything I&#8217;d expected iCloud Photos to be, plus the stunning results that Photos&#8217; AI pulls off by categorizing places, faces and objects in their superior search (not the first time we&#8217;ve heard that). The high point for me was when Assistant made a charming montage from photos and videos of my three-year-old cousin and his day out at the park.
