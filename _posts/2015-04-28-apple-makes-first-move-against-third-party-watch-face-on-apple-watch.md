> **10.7:** Watch Apps whose primary function is telling time will be rejected 

This appears to be Apple&#8217;s first move against allowing third-party watch faces. Although cumbersome, there are still ways of doing this (if not for the guideline), for example, enabling &#8220;Last Opened App&#8221; after the Watch goes to sleep, and having to open the third-party app whenever you interact with the Watch.

This isn&#8217;t dissimilar to the apps which allow you to &#8216;change&#8217; your app icons by pinning a web page using a URL scheme to open the replaced app â€” cumbersome, but achieves the purpose.
