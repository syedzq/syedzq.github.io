Matt Bircher rounded up some of his favorite apps with 3D Touch. I don&#8217;t own an iPhone 6s, so I wouldn&#8217;t know how well they work, but it&#8217;s fascinating to gain an insight into how 3D Touch is being used by different developers for different use cases.

It&#8217;s a great piece well worth a read, with some brilliant high quality images showing off the 3D Touch implementations. I especially love [Overcast&#8217;s](http://overcast.fm) implementation.
