I use Slack for four teams, which is definitely no record, but shows I am clearly dependent on Slack. I also have a fair amount of trust in them, as I&#8217;m clearly using their service for important work/projects. This is the sort of professionality that anyone who gets hacked should handle a situation with. Honesty.
