I reviewed [Ulysses for OS X](http://ulyssesapp.com) for [Yellow Signal](http://yellowsignal.com), my site for app reviews and interviews.

You should read the whole review, but I&#8217;m really happy with the mini-interview toward the end of the review with Marcus Fehn, the co-founder of [The Soulmen](http://the-soulmen.com). He&#8217;s a really smart guy, and I liked his response about developing for iPad:

> The platform restrictions are immense. Screen real estate is very limited, tap targets are huge, there are only a couple of obvious ways to allow interaction etc. For example, we have just submitted a new version which allows iPad users to collapse groups in the sidebar. This is a very basic, well-learned action on Mac: Click the disclosure triangle, done. On iPad, there is no established method to do this, so you need to create your own. And once you do, in come the follow-up problems: How do you manage move operations? How do you manage nested groups? How do you teach users about the options?
