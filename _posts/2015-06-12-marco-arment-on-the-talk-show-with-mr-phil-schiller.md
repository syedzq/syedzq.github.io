Marco Arment writes about being present at the Talk Show Live at WWDC, with Phil Schiller and John Gruber. I&#8217;m anxiously waiting for the video, but this post is a great insight to the atmosphere, mainly (without giving away spoilers), that Phil Schiller _cares_. He reads our blogs, listens to our podcasts. We&#8217;ve seen this from a couple of hints: [links to blogs and articles](https://twitter.com/pschiller/status/609087121383555072), the occasional mention on a keynote slide, but this is the next level.

> Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining.
> 
> It was human.
> 
> And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk.
> 
> Or maybe he just thought it would be cool. He’s a pretty cool guy. I’m glad we got to see that, and we got to see that because of the career, personality, and perspective that John Gruber has been building for over a decade.
