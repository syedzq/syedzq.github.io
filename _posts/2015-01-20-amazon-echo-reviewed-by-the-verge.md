Amazon Echo has always interested me, and this review by [The Verge](http://theverge.com) is great. The last paragraph pretty much sums it up:

> Yet this is the future, Iâ€™m sure of it. Several times a day, the Echo blows me away with how well it converses, and how natural it feels to interact with a machine this way. I just hope Amazon can marshal the considerable time, support, and developer firepower to one day turn this odd black cylinder into the smartest thing in my apartment.
