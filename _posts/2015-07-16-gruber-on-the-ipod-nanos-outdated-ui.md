In an update to an original linked post, John Gruber confirms why the iPod nano still has an iOS 6-like UI:

> Word from a few little birdies is that what remains of the iPod software team is now working on Apple Watch — the Nano UI wasn’t updated to look like iOS 7 because there’s no one left to do it 

Sad, but expected. Working on an iPod nano redesign must be about as exciting as working on an iTunes security update for Windows Vista.
