I interviewed [Adam Oram](http://twitter.com/adamoram) for [Yellow Signal](http://yellowsignal.com), as the first interview as part of the new focus I have for Yellow Signal. The interview was mainly about his work life, productivity, his experiences in the tech journalism circle, and the tools he uses everyday. There&#8217;s one bit which stands out, but of course the whole piece is brilliant and worth a read:

> **In ten years, what would you like to be known for?**
> 
> In ten years, I can only hope to still be writing about technology for a living. Although we don’t know what form popular media will take in the distant future, I’d love to be respected in the tech field as a pundit with an opinion of value. While my words might never hold the weight of John Gruber and the like, I’d like to have a recognized voice in the online tech community. 

Adam is a smart person, and his answers were great. I&#8217;m honored by his willingness to do an interview with us. He writes for [Today’s iPhone](http://www.todaysiphone.com/author/aoram/), and serves as editor-in-chief of [Noted](http://notedtech.net). You can also find him on Twitter [@adamoram](http://twitter.com/adamoram).
