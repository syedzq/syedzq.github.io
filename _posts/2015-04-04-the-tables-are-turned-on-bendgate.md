> The iPhone 6 Plus bends under about 110 pounds of pressure, and reached “catastrophic failure” at 179 pounds. The Galaxy S6 edge reached its bending point at the same amount of pressure as Apple’s phone, but didn’t fare nearly as well overall. The S6 screen cracked at this same bending point pressure, and saw its complete destruction at a lesser 149 pounds. 

A month ago, at the [Samsung Galaxy S6 launch, Young-Hee Lee](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/01/samsung-galaxy-s6_n_6779340.html):

> After the iPhone 6 launched last fall, Apple weathered some bad press when a video surfaced showing the device bending in response to a stress test. Samsung&#8217;s Younghee Lee, executive vice president of the company&#8217;s mobile division, seemed to relish the opportunity for a jab during Sunday&#8217;s press event.
