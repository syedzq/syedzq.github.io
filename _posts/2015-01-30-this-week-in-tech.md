I&#8217;ve missed the boat on a bunch of important news this week, so here&#8217;s a combined linked list of the major events of the past week:

##### January 21

### [Microsoft&#8217;s Big Event](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7865539/microsoft-windows-10-event-what-you-need-to-know)

Microsoft had a huge event last _last_ Wednesday, launching Windows 10 (with Cortana for desktop<sup id="fnref-405-1"><a href="#fn-405-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and a new interface), a new version of Office, a replacement for Internet Explorer, and 84-inch 4K display for meetings (dubbed the &#8220;Surface Hub&#8221;), and something _really_ weird. Microsoft showed off HoloLens, which overlays holographic images on your vision. It seems to take a different stance than the always-on creepy Google Glass. The video Microsoft showed people video conferencing, playing Minecraft, catching up on news and other daily things, which leads me to believe it&#8217;s more for communication and consuming information while performing other tasks that require your attention.

##### January 27

### [Apple Records Breakthrough First Quarter Reports](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/01/27Apple-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Results.html)

Apple announced their highest-ever revenue for the quarter, with a record profit of $18 billion. Apple sold 74.5 million iPhones this quarter, which is phenomenal. They&#8217;ve made more money this quarter than any other company _ever_.

> Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2015 first quarter ended December 27, 2014. The Company posted record quarterly revenue of $74.6 billion and record quarterly net profit of $18 billion, or $3.06 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $57.6 billion and net profit of $13.1 billion, or $2.07 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 39.9 percent compared to 37.9 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. 

Ben Thompson on [Stratechery](http://stratechery.com) also pointed out something very interesting about Apple&#8217;s cash flow:

> It’s difficult to overstate just how absurd this is, but here’s my best attempt: last quarter Apple’s revenue was downright decimated by the strengthening U.S. dollar; currency fluctuations reduced Apple’s revenue by 5% – a cool $3.73 billion dollars. That, though, is more than Google made in profit last quarter ($2.83 billion). Apple lost more money to currency fluctuations than Google makes in a quarter. And yet it’s Google that is feared, and Apple that is feared for. 

Very astute.

### [YouTube Now Defaults to HTML5 Video](http://youtube-eng.blogspot.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html)

I always hated Flash, and [Steve Jobs hated Flash](https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/)<sup id="fnref-405-2"><a href="#fn-405-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Now, almost five years later, the web&#8217;s most popular website that still used Flash has now opted for HTML5-first.

##### January 29

### [Microsoft Outlook for iOS Released](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id951937596)

Microsoft is on a roll. I&#8217;m in love with the new Outlook, despite how it handles iCloud emails with two-factor authentication turned on (poorly). [Yes, I&#8217;ve tried app-specific passwords](https://twitter.com/ismh/status/560794368991588352).

The design is fine, and I love the Mailbox-style swiping to quickly schedule emails, the &#8216;Focused&#8217; view for managing emails, and the integrated planner. When [Microsoft bought Acompli last month](https://www.acompli.com/fwd-microsoft-acquires-acompli/), no one expected them to move this quickly and completely redesign and rebrand the entire app. It&#8217;s definitely worth a look, especially since it&#8217;s free.

##### January 29

### [iTunes Connect Randomly Signs In Developers to Others&#8217; Accounts](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/01/itunes-connect-bug-logs-developers-into-other-developers-accounts-at-random/)

Huge screwup, but it&#8217;s good now.

> This morning, a number of developers signed in to Apple&#8217;s iTunes Connect service only to be greeted by a list of apps that didn&#8217;t belong to them. [TechCrunch has a good roundup of tweets from affected developers](http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/29/itunes-connect-issue-logging-developers-into-other-accounts/) — it seems that whenever developers signed in with their credentials, they were being granted access to other developers&#8217; accounts at random.

<li id="fn-405-1">
  I&#8217;m really surprised that in 9 months, Microsoft a) released a voice assistant, and b) ported it over to desktop, whereas Siri has been around since 2011 and hasn&#8217;t made the jump to OS X yet.&#160;<a href="#fnref-405-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

  And also the Oxford comma, it would seem (paragraph 5, line 3).&#160;<a href="#fnref-405-2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
