> But now that I’ve gotten used to it, the situational weirdness that arises carrying such a big phone is well-worth it to me. The screen is great, the camera is sweet and the battery life is a game-changer. 

#MykeWasRight.

**Update:** Here&#8217;s [Jason Snell](http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/04/two-weeks-with-the-iphone-6-plus/) and [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2015/04/06/life-with-the-iphone-6-plus) respectively on the same point. Snell:

> I really did appreciate the iPhone 6 Plus’s longer battery life. The longer life is noticeable, and was much appreciated as I was wandering around London. And I got used to the size of the device in my pocket in no time. But beyond that, I have to say I’m hard pressed to find anything I prefer about the iPhone 6 Plus over my iPhone 6. Yes, the screen is larger, but I didn’t ever feel that I was seeing more of the world by viewing an extra tweet in Twitterrific or a little bit more territory in Maps. 

Arment:

> Apple’s obsession with thinness as the top design priority, spending most of the technical progress that accumulates over time on size reduction rather than increased battery life, is also likely to blame for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus’ worst design flaw: their slippery sides, which exacerbate their unsuitability for one-handed use. (The tolerable but unfortunate camera bulge is another victim of thinness-above-all-else design priorities.)
