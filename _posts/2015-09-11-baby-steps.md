I&#8217;m taking the first step into iOS development.

A huge dream of mine is to make cool apps. I&#8217;ve dabbled in iOS app development before. I made a few apps based on tutorials, but it was never anything serious.

Last June during WWDC, I looked at the student scholarship page once again.

_I could have been there._

_I want to be there._

Looking through those pages, I&#8217;m feeling a pang of regret. I could have been there — I could have _tried_, had I started seriously learning a year ago.

The scholarship is available for any student, but to be honest, I want to be in there before I&#8217;m 18. But there&#8217;s no chance of me getting in there if I don&#8217;t start.

Today, instead of setting another goal I won&#8217;t complete, I&#8217;m _publicly_ promising that I will learn iOS before next June. I&#8217;ll do that by learning a bit every day, looking at tutorials, trying it out myself, and taking the plunge. I&#8217;ve only got a few years left of being in high school, and I don&#8217;t want to spend them wishing I&#8217;d spent a few hours here and there learning how to make apps.

Every day, I want to spend at least an hour learning iOS. Today, it&#8217;s September 11. The deadline for the WWDC student scholarship will probably be April 25. That&#8217;s 227 days, or 7 months, 14 days.

That should be enough time to at least start cracking.
