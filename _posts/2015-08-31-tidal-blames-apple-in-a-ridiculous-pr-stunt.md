> If you opened up Tidal last night, you would have found it streaming Lil Wayne’s Lil Weezyana Fest in New Orleans. That is, up until Drake came on. As Drake took the stage for a brief set, Tidal cut its stream and put up a message. &#8220;Apple is interfering with artistry and will not allow this artist to stream,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Sorry for Big Brother’s inconvenience.&#8221; 

This is a pure PR move, hoping to make Tidal seem like the good guys — Apple had _nothing_ to do with this.

> But all of that may be misinformation. According to BuzzFeed News, Apple had no say in Drake&#8217;s stream being cut. The report says that Apple did not threaten to sue Tidal over the appearance — it supposedly didn&#8217;t even know that the event was going on. Instead, Drake&#8217;s manager says that it was &#8220;100 percent&#8221; his decision not to stream the performance. &#8220;Apple doesn’t have the power to stop us from being part of a live stream,&#8221; his manager says. Drake&#8217;s camp apparently didn&#8217;t want his set streamed because they were unable to ensure that it &#8220;represented us in the right way.&#8221;
