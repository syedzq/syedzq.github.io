Honest and very true piece by [Matt Birchler](http://www.birchtree.me/blog/explaining-our-tech-obsessions-to-non-tech-people):

> I have gone back and forth with people many times about how expensive Apple products are and how it’s irrational to buy them when there is tech that is just as good and does all the same things which cost half the price. This argument was always frustrating because I didn’t have a great answer. When talking about the iPhone I would mention that it has a better camera, higher build quality, and a better interface than the cheap phones on the market. Often this would be received with a “but who cares?” response.

> Then I was at lunch with some people from work and we were discussing high end cars. I’m not much of a car guy, but my co-workers were going on and on about the new [insert cool cars here] and how they compare to last year’s models and how you can spend a little more to get something even better. I should also note that all of these guys drive nicer cars than they need to survive. I’m the guy with a Hyundai Accent and a bike that I ride to work, and these guys are driving around sports cars with aftermarket enhancements. I love hearing these guys talk about this stuff because I understand the passion they feel for their hobby. I don’t feel that for cars (my Accent gets almost 50 MPG highway and is safe, which are the most important things), but I do feel it for tech. 

A great analogy. The same thing is seen with (analog) watches, jewelry, and other &#8216;luxuries&#8217;, but the difference is that our tech obsessions are cheaper, and therefore much more accessible.
