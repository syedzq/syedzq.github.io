Steven Levy interviewed Google&#8217;s Bruce Horowitz, VP of Streams, Photos, and Sharing about their recently-launched product, Google Photos, and the fate of Google Plus.

A few parts stood out to me:

> We have a proliferation of devices and storage and bandwidth, to the point where every single moment of our life can be saved and recorded. But you don’t get a second life with which to curate, review, and appreciate the first life. You almost need a second vacation to go through the pictures of the safari on your first vacation. That’s the problem we’re trying to fix — to automate the process so that users can be in the moment. 

This is _so_ crucial. I don&#8217;t have time to filter through family photos, delete them, even though I&#8217;ve tried with Photos and iCloud Photo Library. And Google Photos&#8217; Assistant feature is amazing for this kind of work. Somehow, it created a endearing video of a three-year-old walking around a park, with a fitting score accompanying, even centering on my cousin in other types of photos. We also take a lot of photos of the same thing, because someone moves, their eyes are closed, or similar issues. Assistant made a _GIF_ of those, which is truly amazing. Search auto-creates filters, by location, face (no names!), and even objects — for examples, pictures you&#8217;ve taken of giraffes.

> We heard from our Google Plus photo users that we had great technology, but they didn’t want their life’s archive brought into a social product, any social product. It’s more akin to Gmail — there’s no button on Gmail that says “publish on the Internet.” “Broadcast” and “archive” are really different and so part of Google photos is to create a safe space for your photos and remove any stigma associated with saving everything. For instance, I use my phone to take pictures of receipts, and pictures of signs that I want to remember and things like that. These can potentially pollute my photo stream. We make it so that things like that recede into the background, so there’s no cognitive burden to actually saving everything. 

This is the right direction, but as much as I like it, I am still wary about privacy concerns. On face recognition:

> **Does the face recognition in this product understand who the person actually is, in the same way your search engine might identify a person and link the image to information about that person?**
> 
> Not in this incarnation of the product. If you look at the faces we have here Google has no idea who these people are, it’s actually face clustering, not face-recognition, so I can click on my stepdaughter Charlotte and see other pictures of her. But it doesn’t know Charlotte’s identity [and can’t make use of any of her own personal information]. 

And the giant:

> Google’s effort to organize the world’s information includes the concept of our proactively bringing you that information even in advance of a conscious need for it. A great example of that is Google Now: before, I had to remember to ask if my flight is on time. Now, that information finds me. So we’ve already realized that in some of our products. I think that our team, and Google at large, has incredible competency in understanding content and understanding users and marrying those things and delivering that content to users in a proactive, useful way. We don’t necessarily talk about the perfect stream using those words, but we do think a lot about how to bring the right information to the right user at the right time, in the right moment. That is a Google-wide company mission and you’ll see that manifest in every product we have. The service for that is not localized in a particular product, it’s company-level.
