Huge news again from Mark Gurman. Not as big as the 12&#8243; MacBook that disrupted CES, but still huge:

> Within Apple, the application is currently called the Apple Watch “Companion” app for iPhone. This application manages settings for Apple Watch applications, as well as settings for iPhone/Watch interactivity. 

I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about the monogram. I&#8217;ll have to wait until I see it. There also doesn&#8217;t seem to be Touch ID support in the Apple Watch &#8211; the piece strongly suggests a passcode lock. But apparently unlocking your iPhone should unlock your Watch as well.

> **Unlock with iPhone**
    
> When this is on, unlocking your iPhone will automatically unlock you Apple Watch – as long as you&#8217;re wearing it. 

But it&#8217;s unlikely I&#8217;ll reach into my pocket to activate my iPhone with Touch ID before using my Apple Watch.

I also find it completely ludicrous that you&#8217;ll have to reenter credit card details if you remove or change the passcode.
