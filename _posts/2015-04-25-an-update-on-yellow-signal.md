[A few weeks ago](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2015/04/07/soulver-review-and-meta-things/ "Soulver Review, and Meta Things"), I decided that I needed to sort things out a bit. I was torn between this blog, and the new blog, [Yellow Signal](yellowsignal.com "Yellow Signal"). I put linked posts on both blogs, struggled between differentiating them, and had no idea how to divide my time between them.

I did my main app reviews, arguably my best writing so far, on Yellow Signal, with only measly linked posts on this blog. It’s been a long time since I’ve written any worthy analytical piece on this blog, which is ironic considering that was its purpose.

I’ve tried redefining the purpose of Yellow Signal, and I think I’ve found the perfect way of doing so.

I’ve outlined our new focus for Yellow Signal in a post which can be found [here](http://yellowsignal.com/a-new-focus/ "A New Focus - Yellow Signal"), but I haven’t really talked about what’s happening to this blog. The idea is that Yellow Signal will be all about app reviews and interviews, instead of the tutorials, reviews _and_ interviews as planned before. We plan to put out a review and an interview every week, so that it’s not taxing on both of us ([Harshit](harshit.in "Harshit") is helping me out too). We’re planning on alternating who does the review and the interview.

As for this blog, I’m excited to finally do a bit more regular writing for Command-Z. In addition to the daily linked list, I’d like to publish a few analytical articles and thoughts too, especially with the launch of the Apple Watch and what it means for users and developers alike.

To paraphrase [Jim Gordon](http://gotham.fox.com/post/112720285532/its-a-new-day-at-the-gcpd "It's a new day in the GCPD - Gotham Fox"), “It’s a new day for Command-Z.”
