Simple, easy-to-follow tutorial from Jeff Benjamin at [iDownloadBlog](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/03/21/how-to-get-apple-watch-activity-app-ios-8-2-no-jailbreak/).

The Activity app requires an Apple Watch to activate. From my own experience, I find that the design is like a dark version of Apple&#8217;s Calendar app, but with San Francisco as the UI font for everything except navigation buttons and tab bar button labels. Without the Apple Watch, it shows the steps you&#8217;ve taken and the approximate distance traveled. I have mixed feelings about the app, and can&#8217;t make much of a judgment without having used the app in its entirety.
