![Safari's new Pinned Tab feature.](http://zaidsyed.com/images/pinned-tab-icon.png)
  
Among the many new features OS X El Capitan brings to Safari is the pinned tabs feature, a feature that has slowly been added to other browsers. In [OS X Snowsemite](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/02/10/snowsemite/), this feature has been brought to Safari.

When you pin a tab by dragging it over to the left of the window, the tab title shrinks and displays only a favicon<sup id="fnref-1279-1"><a href="#fn-1279-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of the site. Behind the scenes, that tab is marked as a &#8216;priority&#8217; site —&nbsp;it fetches new data in the background continuously, so sites like [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com) can refresh in the background so you see new content every time you visit it.

Another benefit of keeping a pinned tab is that you can&#8217;t accidentally close it —&nbsp;I can&#8217;t count the number of times I&#8217;ve left a podcast open in [Overcast&#8217;s web client](http://overcast.fm)<sup id="fnref-1279-2"><a href="#fn-1279-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and accidentally `CMD-W`&#8216;ed the tab. If you try and close a pinned tab, Safari shifts focus to the closest unpinned tab, so you can&#8217;t accidentally close your most important sites. Of course, you can still `CMD-Q` — quitting still terminates Safari. But when you reopen Safari, pinned tabs remain open, even if you have Safari set to open a new window on a new start. If you pin a tab, it will remain pinned until you unpin it by dragging it back to the right, converting it back into a normal, unprivileged tab.

Pinned tabs are perfect for any sites that needs to continuously fetch new data, and for sites which provide multimedia content you need open in the background —&nbsp;Twitter, Facebook, Overcast, YouTube are all good examples of sites you&#8217;d want to pin. Even sites you regularly visit or need open — for example your Google Drive files, or your work intranet (if they still use those).

  Well, it&#8217;s not exactly a favicon — the website creator has to provide an SVG of the site favicon to be used for pinned tabs. I&#8217;ve done it for this site. El Capitan testers can pin this site to show the pinned tab icon for this site.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1279-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

  Because there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a decent OS X podcast app around. Seriously, OS X developers, <em>what</em> is up?&#160;<a href="#fnref-1279-2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
