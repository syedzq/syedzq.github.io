> If that feels too nebulous, here’s a tip: Instead of picking a dollar amount, think of something you’d trade. I call it object value pricing. If your friend’s mom wanted you to design and build a one-page website, would you do it for a fast food dinner? What about a new 42&#8243; TV? A new camera? That Ikea sofa you’ve been meaning to get?
