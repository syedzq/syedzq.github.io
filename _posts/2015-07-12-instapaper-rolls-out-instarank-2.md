> Today, we’re excited to announce the release of InstaRank v2, an update to our InstaRank algorithm, which identifies popular, high-quality content across Instapaper. In this update, InstaRank will retain its focus on identifying high-quality content but with an added emphasis on discovering great material from less popular domains. 

A very welcome change. I'm happy that so many services and applications are being more open to smaller sites that still produce great content. This is a big win for independent writers and bloggers.

I've also seen this trend in Apple News on iOS 9 beta 3. From the beginning, I added smaller blogs — the excellent [_BirchTree_](http://birchtree.me) by Matt Birchler, etc., and I was mildly surprised to find other similar blogs I had never been to in my &ldquo;For You&rdquo;, alongside _The New York Times_ and _The Verge_.
