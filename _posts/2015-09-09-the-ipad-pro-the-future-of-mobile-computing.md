Today at Apple’s Special Event held in the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, Apple announced iPad Pro, alongside a brand-new Apple TV and new iPhones.

The iPad Pro is a 12.9-inch sized version of the original 9.7-inch iPad, with double the CPU performance, and brand-new accessories that help make the iPad Pro a productivity and creativity powerhouse.

Firstly, the display has been revamped to take full use of the amazing 13-inch screen. The screen resolution is 2732 by 2048 pixels, making the iPad Pro&#8217;s display great for immersive experience such as games and videos, but also content creation, such as drawing, video-editing (to some extent), and writing. Despite the large size, the iPad Pro is only 6.9 millimeters thick, and with a display of that size, a lot of processing power is used. To keep the iPad in check, the display uses variable refresh rates to distinguish between static content — sites, books (which run at 30fps) — and videos and games, which need more power to run, and looks best at 60fps. A powerful, 64-bit desktop class A9X chip allows for performance better than most PCs in the industry, according to Apple, while still keeping battery life to 10 hours.

The iPad Pro&#8217;s real power comes not only with its size, but also the accessories that come with it. The Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard are iPad Pro-specific accessories that are designed to assist both professionals and hobbyists alike in their trade: the Apple Pencil is designed for use by both artists and enterprise users, for which a whole new multitasking system was invented to allow for distinction between finger presses and those from the Apple Pencil. The display can also detect angle and pressure. Due to this, when sketching, apps can sense pressure applied by the Pencil to draw darker and broader lines, and also add shading based on the angle the Pencil is used at. While more advanced perhaps for use by artists and creative professionals, the Apple Pencil can also be sued by enterprise users as a markup input device — the Mail app supports annotations with the Apple Pen, a feature that can be supported by developers in their own apps. The Apple Pencil also has reduced latency — the time between the user drawing a line and when the system renders it due to an advanced prediction system introduced in iOS 9.

The Apple Pencil also has a lightning connector, and must be charged by connecting to the iPad.

The Keyboard case is a full-sized case for the iPad with a built-in fabric keyboard, with keys based on the butterfly key design that came with the MacBook in March, and is resistant to both water and stains. The Smart Keyboard has a new &#8216;Smart Connector&#8217; that allows both power and data to be transferred both ways.

The Apple Pencil is sold for $99, and the Smart Keyboard for $169.

The iPad Pro also comes with four speakers on both sides, Touch ID, and an 8MP camera.

The real power of the iPad Pro comes in the software multitasking features that arrive with iOS 9: Slide Over, which allows users to slide over apps from the side to quickly check for updates, Split View, a powerful feature that allows to apps to run side-by-side, and Picture-in-Picture for videos and FaceTime calls that detach from their apps and can float on top of others.

The real power of the iPad Pro is in the built-in hardware, software multi-tasking features, and the accessories that help make it easy to both consume _and_ create on the iPad.

The iPad Pro starts at $799 for a 32GB model and will be available in November.
