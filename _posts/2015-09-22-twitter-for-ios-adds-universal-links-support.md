Another reason to use the official Twitter app. Too bad I can&#8217;t stand it.

> In an update that added full support for quick replies to notifications and the ability to view muted and blocked accounts in Settings, Twitter also brought Universal Links to its iOS app today.
> 
> Available for devices running iOS 9, Universal Links are regular HTTP links that, when tapped, will open the relevant view in a native app instead, with an option to view in Safari. Universal Links are safe, shared across platforms, and they can only be enabled by apps that have associated websites.
