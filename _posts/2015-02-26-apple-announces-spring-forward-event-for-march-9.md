Apple sent out invites to select members of the press for an event taking place on March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center, previously the home of iPad launch events.

Obviously, Apple will introduce more Apple Watch details and announce advanced pricing and shipping dates, but we may also see a few more updates on the software side â€” perhaps Apple&#8217;s new streaming system.
