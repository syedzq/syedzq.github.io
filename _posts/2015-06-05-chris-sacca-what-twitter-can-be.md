Chris Sacca, longtime investor and shareholder in Twitter on what Twitter needs to do to do better.

> Hundreds of millions of new users will join and stay active on Twitter, hundreds of millions of inactive users will return to Twitter, and hundreds of millions more will use Twitter from the outside if Twitter can:
> 
> + Make Tweets effortless to enjoy,
    
> + Make it easier for all to participate, and
    
> + Make each of us on Twitter feel heard and valuable. 

I agree with most of the points he states in this fascinating piece. However, I use Twitter in a strictly chronological order, and as a pro user, have configured my timeline to be just how I want. But these changes, if implemented, can be _fenomenal_.
