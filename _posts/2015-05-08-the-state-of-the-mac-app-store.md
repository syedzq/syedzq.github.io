> There were 37 guesses. I threw out the lowest and highest guesses which were both hilarious. The average guess was $12,460.67.

>   * Units: 94
>   * Proceeds: $302
>   * Sales: $452

> 7 of those units were promo codes I sent out. Only 59 of those units were in the US. It&#8217;s pretty nuts that 59 sales is top paid on the Mac App Store in the US. 

Life in the Mac App Store is pretty bad. What with developers moving away to reclaim 30%, and with piracy becoming easier on the Mac, no wonder the Mac App Store isn&#8217;t doing too good.
