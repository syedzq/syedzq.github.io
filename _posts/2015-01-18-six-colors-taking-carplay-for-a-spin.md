Jason Snell tried out CarPlay, and the video he made about it is pretty interesting.

> Inspired by Marco Arment, I bought a Pioneer SPH-DA120 CarPlay receiver and some accessories, so I could test out Apple’s CarPlay in-car technology without buying a new car or tearing apart my existing car. While I haven’t had the opportunity to use CarPlay while driving, I’ve spent some time with it over the past couple of months, enough to form some initial judgements. 

(He didn&#8217;t actually fit the Pioneer receiver in his car though.)
