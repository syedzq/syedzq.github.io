Great article from a while ago I had saved in my Instapaper queue.

I love books, but after starting this blog, being involved in so many projects, and even more school stuff, it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve read a book. As of now, I have a _huge_ list of books to read (thanks to [this](http://bookriot.com/2013/06/13/from-zero-to-well-read-in-100-books/)), as well as _Becoming Steve Jobs_ from a while ago and about two great business-related reads.

I aim to recover my habit for reading books this summer, with no school, but it&#8217;s going to be hard to do with Twitter, RSS and Instapaper around. Here&#8217;s what the author of this great piece, Hugh McGuire, did about it:

>   * No more Twitter, Facebook, or article reading during the work day (hard)
>   * No reading of random news articles (hard)
>   * No smartphones or computers in the bedroom (easy)
>   * No TV after dinner (it turns out, easy)
    
>     Instead, go straight to bed and start reading a book — usually on an eink ereader (it turns out, easy)
    
>     The shocking thing was how quickly my mind adapted to accommodate reading books again. I had expected to fight for that concentration — but I didn’t have to fight. With less digital input (no pre-bed TV, especially), extra time (no TV, again), and without a tempting digital device near at hand … there was time and space for my mind to settle into a book.

> What a wonderful feeling it was. 

I&#8217;m sure it was.
