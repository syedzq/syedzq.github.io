Today at Apple&#8217;s Special Event held in the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, Apple announced the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, featuring new updates and improvements such as 3D Touch, Live Photos, 4K video recording support, a 12-megapixel camera, and improved performance.

3D Touch is billed as a new feature that&#8217;s essentially an expansion of the Force Touch features that were introduced with the Apple Watch and MacBook. 3D Touch senses two different levels of pressure, which allow the user to perform two actions: Peek, and Press.

In supported apps like Mail and Messages, applying pressure on the screen can preview message content and perform actions to it without opening a new view, while adding more pressure &#8216;pops&#8217; the peeked content into the original, full view. Content that can be &#8216;peeked&#8217; are web pages, Maps directions, flights, and images.

Another feature of 3D Touch is Quick Actions, which are shortcuts users can access by pressing app icons in the home screen, as [Mark Gurman revealed earlier for _9to5Mac_](http://9to5mac.com/2015/08/10/force-touch-on-iphone-6s-revealed-expect-shortcuts-faster-actions-across-ios/). For example, users can press the Phone app icon to easily call favorite contacts, or press the Camera icon to quickly take selfies, record videos, or just a simple photo.

3D Touch also allows for advanced gestures, for example pressing and dragging moves the keyboard&#8217;s cursor to select text easily, and swipe easily from the left edge to swipe back to the last-used app. The feature also allows for pressure-sensitive input, for example in the new Notes app.

Live Photos is a joyful feature that can help make pictures appear more lively. By default, when users take photos, the camera also takes shots before and after the shot to create a GIF-like animation when the image is pressed. These images can also be set as &#8216;dynamic&#8217; lock screen wallpapers.

The iPhone 6s also has an improved camera, now receiving a bump from the previous 8MP to 12. This also means that the video recorder will be able to shoot 30fps 4K video, and 60fps 1080p. The front-facing FaceTime HD camera is now 5MP, allowing for clearer selfies, as well as the addition of &#8220;flash&#8221; — essentially, the screen lights up to give the impression of flash photography, similar to Snapchat&#8217;s implementation of the feature.

Behind the scenes, the iPhone 6s has a new A9 chip, which Apple describes can handle &#8220;gaming console-class&#8221; graphics performance, and a 70% faster CPU, and a 90% faster GPU. Touch ID is also twice as fast.

The iPhone 6s comes in one additional finish — the rose gold option, bringing the tally up to four choices of finish — space gray, silver, gold, and rose gold, with a slightly pinkish hue.

The iPhone 6s comes in two sizes: the 6s and the 6s Plus. The 6s starts at $199, and the 6s Plus $299 for the 16GB storage sizes. Preorders start on September 12, and order ship on September 25.

An additional option is available for US retail customers. The iPhone Upgrade program allows customers to get a new iPhone annually with AppleCare+ warranty for $32.41 per month. This is available only to US customers of AT&T, Sprint, Verizon or T-Mobile.
