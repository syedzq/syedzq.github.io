[Peter Kafka over at Recode](http://recode.net/author/peter-kafka/) has a pretty good rundown of Sunday&#8217;s events.

Kafka even got on the phone with Eddy Cue:

> Cue says that Swift’s letter, coupled with complaints from indie labels and artists, did indeed prompt the change. He said he discussed the about-face with Apple CEO Tim Cook today. “It’s something we worked on together. Ultimately, we both wanted to make the change.”
> 
> Cue says Apple will pay rights holders for the entire three months of the trial period. It can’t be at the same rate that Apple is paying them after free users become subscribers, since Apple is paying out a percentage of revenue once subscribers start paying. Instead, he says, Apple will pay rights holders on a per-stream basis, the amount of which he won’t disclose. 

It&#8217;s still pretty amazing that Apple responded to Swift&#8217;s blog post — but of course, people are speculating that this was all just a PR stunt. I disagree with this, but I see where they&#8217;re coming from — a quick browse through Taylor Swift&#8217;s Twitter replies yields multitudes of users now swearing to use Apple Music in lieu of competitors. It&#8217;s clear that Apple&#8217;s already won, especially with at least 59 million followers now willing to use the only &#8220;fair&#8221; streaming service around, Apple Music.
