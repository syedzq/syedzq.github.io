[Recent events](https://twitter.com/s_bielefeld) have made me very disappointed in the actions of &#8216;Samantha Bielefeld&#8217;, someone who you may have heard of. While I don&#8217;t understand the whole situation, I understand that &#8216;Bielefeld&#8217; is actually a man pretending to be a woman in order to write from a &#8216;unique&#8217; perspective.

I feel betrayed by this, but more so that I&#8217;ve duped my own readers. I&#8217;ve updated all posts concerning this issue, including my &#8216;Thoughts on the Patronage Model Debate&#8217; post.

More to come.
