Samsung recently [offered iPhone users a test drive of the Galaxy S6](http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-offering-iphone-users-galaxy-note-5-test-drive-30-days), and Matt Birchler, writing for his blog [BirchTree](http://birchtree.me) recenty gave it a try:

This paragraph sums up today&#8217;s Android experience for the iPhone user:

> Outside of the few Android features I enjoyed, there&#8217;s really nothing here that makes me want to keep this phone and hock my iPhone on eBay tomorrow. And even if Apple did something terrible and I simply couldn&#8217;t support them anymore, there are plenty of other Android phones out there, like the Moto X and OnePlus Two, that are much less expensive (half or less the cost) and offer basically the same things. 

Android has changed a lot, and many iOS users still have preconceptions about this ecosystem from a while back. While many of Android&#8217;s new features _are_ innovative, for many of us iOS users, including myself and Matt Birchler, think that iOS is still the best ecosystem, and has the better phones.
