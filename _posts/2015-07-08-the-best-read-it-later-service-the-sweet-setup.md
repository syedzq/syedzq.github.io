Great roundup from Robert McGinley Myers, and I thoroughly agree with his opinions.

> Instapaper has evolved over the years, but it remains our favorite read-it-later service because of its relentless focus on that primary purpose of the app: reading. 

This is exactly the reason why I switched from [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) to [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com). The plethora of typefaces, various reading options, and even a Send-to-Kindle action â€” it&#8217;s clear the folks behind Instapaper are following Marco Arment&#8217;s purpose behind Instapaper.

I still wish Instapaper did multimedia parsing better but, hey, there&#8217;s always more to work on.
