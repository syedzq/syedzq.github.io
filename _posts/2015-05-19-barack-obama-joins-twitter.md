Wait, didn&#8217;t that happen already? Not really. The Twitter account everyone&#8217;s familiar with is [@BarackObama](http://twitter.com/barackobama), while this is the [@POTUS](http://twitter.com/potus) account, which appears to be temporary, passing on to the next presidential candidate.

As [John Gruber notes](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/05/18/barack-obama-twitter), &#8216;Obama&#8217; uses an iPhone as his client, but [this New York Times piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/obama-joins-twitter-universe-but-hes-not-following-you.html) suggests that it may in fact belong to a member of the Executive Office.
