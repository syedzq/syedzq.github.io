App Camp 4 Girls is a great initiative, introducing programming and app development to a new generation that will, hopefully, be able to increase the number of women working in the technology industry.

Recently, this great initiative (recognized by Apple as a STEM organization for this year&#8217;s WWDC) released their first app. Here&#8217;s [Jean MacDonald on the app](http://appcamp4girls.com/new/2015/4/28/quiz-compendium-app-released.html):

> Today we released our very first App Camp app! The Quiz Compendium includes 15 personality quizzes created by camper project teams. You&#8217;ll learn so many things about yourself, such as what your superpower is, where you should go on vacation, and even what your breakfast choices say about your personality.  

It&#8217;s only $0.99, so it&#8217;s more like a donation that gives back.

My superpower is &#8220;food powers&#8221;, which is troubling considering I&#8217;m trying to lose weight.
