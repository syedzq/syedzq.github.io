Matt Bircher tried out Android on a trial Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, and compared his experience to iOS:

> The story is still about the same. I will definitely be keeping my iPhone at the end of this trial, but I&#8217;m going to use this month to live in Android to really understand the platform. I write a lot about this stuff, and I want to make sure my knowledge of Android is based on how it is today, not how I remember it being years ago. Basically, I&#8217;m doing it so I don&#8217;t get called an idiot for not understanding Android&#8230; I&#8217;m sure I still will&#8230; 

It&#8217;s a good read to understand how Android works today, and you get the (somewhat more open) viewpoint on Android from the perspective of an iPhone user.
