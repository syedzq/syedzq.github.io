Great article by Femke van Schoonhoven for her latest project, [The Apartment](http://theapartment.co). The article is about how design students should freelance during their studies to gain some real-world experience:

> As a student it’s easy to get caught up in student life and not venture further afield. When working with clients you may have to attend a meeting with a design team, meet developers or exchange emails with their agency. Your client could have good connections.

> [&#8230;]
> 
> You may be thinking that you’re doing pretty well for yourself just focusing on your school work, but imagine the possibilities of taking on a client in your spare time and exercising your passion outside of the classroom. 

You don&#8217;t even have to wait until university or college — I started in high school.
