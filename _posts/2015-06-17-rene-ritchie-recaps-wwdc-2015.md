Great recap of WWDC 2015 by Rene Ritchie. A comprehensive guide to be used for years to come.

> Those who felt Apple had moved too fast in previous years got the focus on stability they were craving, but not at the expense of continuing to move forward. Those who felt Apple had fallen behind on machine learning got to see how smart our data could be while remaining safely on-device.
> 
> Those who called Apple out on diversity got to see outstanding women take the stage. And those who&#8217;d been wondering how Apple would tackle music in a post-download world got their answer.
> 
> There were no radical redesigns or fundamental functional changes at WWDC 2015. There was no race for developers to figure out how they would have to redo their apps to strip away textures, add Auto Layout or TextKit, implement size classes or extensions. This year, if they&#8217;d done all that, they got their reward â€” San Francisco as the new system font, multi-window multitasking on the iPad, search APIs.
> 
> They got a future that&#8217;s starting to come to them.
