More goodies from Eddy Cue tonight. Billboard managed to get hold of Eddy Cue for nine questions about Apple&#8217;s recent change of heart regarding paying artists during the Apple Music three-month trial.

He even appeared to dodge a couple of questions.

> **Cue:** Going through all of this to get to the right place and get a great service to fans, that&#8217;s the really important part.
