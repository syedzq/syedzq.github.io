Samsung&#8217;s preparing a new entry into the smartwatch market with their own response to the Digital Crown found on Apple Watch.

Rather than stick to watch conventions, it appears they&#8217;ve turned to a Nest-like solution for scrolling, zooming and all the things the Crown does in a circular watch face, dubbed the &#8216;rotating bezel&#8217;.

From certain images, it also appears that the scrolling mechanism can also be use to input numbers and letters, similar to the click wheel found on the older iPods.

It&#8217;s also evident from screenshots that circular displays are just not right for software-based watches â€” scrolling through lists looks terrible, with labels being truncated.

> The Next Gear, as it&#8217;s referred to in developer materials, will have a 2G data connection, GPS, and a slew of sensors including an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a pressure sensor, and a heartbeat monitor. The watch will have a metal frame with a 1.18-inch 360 x 360 display at 305ppi. But the most stand-out feature is what surrounds that display: a &#8220;rotating bezel&#8221; used to navigate the interface.
