> I asked Siri “When will the Apple Watch be released” and she said the device will make “its timely appearance” (no pun intended, I’m sure) on April 24.
> 
> “But starting April 10, you can pre-order one, or check it out at an Apple retail store,” she added.
> 
> Repeating the same questions yields different variants of the same response. In another instance, Siri reminded me no to forget to say hi when checking out the Watch at an Apple Store. 

Siri also advertises the Watch in more mundane questions.

> But were you to ask a more mundane questions such as ”What are you doing?,” you’d get something like, “Just got back from IL8. Mining some alumin-ium for the Apple Watch”.
> 
> The alumin-ium here is a funny reference to Apple design head Jony Ive’s precise Oxford British pronunciation of the word aluminum (in British English, ‘aluminum’ is spelled as ‘aluminum’)
