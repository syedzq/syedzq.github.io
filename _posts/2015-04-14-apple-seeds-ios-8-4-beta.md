Juli Clover for [MacRumors](http://macrumors.com):

> iOS 8.4 introduces a newly-revamped Music app, which includes a new design that shows pictures of artists in the Artists view and offers personalized playlists. It also offers a new MiniPlayer, a redesigned look for &#8220;Now Playing,&#8221; global search capabilities that make it easier to search from anywhere within the Music app, and a streamlined design for iTunes Radio to improve music discovery. 

While I don&#8217;t use the Music app at all, I presume these changes will be welcome to many. Despite the iOS 7 redesign<sup id="fnref-832-1"><a href="#fn-832-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Music.app really didn&#8217;t have any modern interface changes that apps like Spotify feature. The MiniPlayer, reminiscent of Marco Arment&#8217;s [Overcast](http://overcast.fm), but featured in many other audio apps is also a welcome addition.

<li id="fn-832-1">
  There really should be a broader term for this change, especially since we&#8217;re already heading for iOS 9.&#160;<a href="#fnref-832-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
