Amazon has updated the Kindle app for iOS with a custom typeface called &#8216;Bookerly&#8217;, a combination of Baskerville and last year&#8217;s Caecilia.

Even better, the new layout engine fixes the problems with terrible text justification, as John Brownlee points out on _[Fast Company](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3046678/the-kindle-finally-gets-typography-that-doesnt-suck)_.
