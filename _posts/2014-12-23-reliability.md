In last [week&#8217;s episode of Connected](http://www.relay.fm/connected/18), Stephen Hackett and Federico Viticci made an interesting point.

Shortly on the heels of the topic of Apple&#8217;s numerous iOS 8 widget rejections, Hackett states that there are no more metaphorical &#8220;low-hanging fruits&#8221; left on iOS &#8211; the average user is mostly satisfied by iOS these days, in terms of features. It&#8217;s the geeky power users like Hackett and the people who read this blog who want something more out of iOS &#8211; in this case, it&#8217;s the extensions, Today view widgets and third-party keyboards which iOS 8 brought to the table. And in doing this, Apple managed to piss off the average user who doesn&#8217;t care about extensions and widgets, due to the insane unstableness of the most recent iteration of Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system. iOS 8 is the buggiest software release Apple has ever shipped, second only, in my opinion, to OS X Yosemite.

Viticci followed up on that point. &#8220;Reliability is the new low-hanging fruit.&#8221;
  
This represents the cold hard truth now. As iOS matures, and as Apple now turns to more powerful features to serve power users, focus has diverted from the three words that made Apple what it was before: &#8220;It just works.&#8221;

In Apple&#8217;s rush to open up their operating systems to developers, Apple has turned a blind eye to the stability of iOS and Yosemite in general. To the point that the average users simply don&#8217;t trust Apple to give them what they want anymore.

Apple&#8217;s made many mistakes, but their first huge screwup with Tim Cook in the driver&#8217;s seat was Apple Maps. I&#8217;m not talking about the technical difficulties, the lack of accuracy or the half-baked, distorted Flyover feature. It&#8217;s the lack of attention to detail Apple has been known for finally making its way into the public eye. Apple reporters and people who write Apple blogs have all been writing about Apple&#8217;s little inconsistencies or mishaps since Antennagate. But Apple Maps was touted to be one of iOS 6&#8217;s biggest &#8216;features&#8217;. When the mass public finally received iOS 6 the next morning, they found in the place of Google Maps a poor replacement that frankly _didn&#8217;t just work_. The average consumer doesn&#8217;t care about Apple&#8217;s feud with Google, they want a maps application that works. And for once, Apple wasn&#8217;t able to provide something that does _just work_.

It was after this event that the average consumer started asking their geeky friend if it was &#8220;safe to update&#8221; to the next iOS software release. Customers lost trust in Apple in their ability to provide them something that worked. Consumers could identify Apple to do three things: (a) create a product that worked, (b) without much tinkering or hassle (easy to use) and (c) looked beautiful. Apple, with Apple Maps delivered on the latter two but not on the most important one: _working_.

iOS 7 brought its own glitches, but many thought it was justified given the massive undertaking that the teams of Craig Federighi and Jony Ive brought to the Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system. The functionality remained the same, but Apple this time focused on (arguably) sacrificing the second expectation, making everything easy to use, to make iOS 7 look even more stunning, beautiful and simple.

OS X Yosemite is the most buggiest software release Apple has ever shipped. I was psyched for the new features Apple promised with their new desktop operating system. Continuity, to tie together OS X and iOS into one beautifully-wrapped package. The new interface looked less distracting, and more focused on the tasks you had to perform (after all, who uses computers for fun anymore?). And the addition of extensions &#8211; just like in iOS 8 &#8211; made the upgrade much more appealing for a power user like me.

Except, the third month in, I&#8217;ve found myself switching to (the unintuitive, yet reliable) Chrome for important work-related tasks I can&#8217;t bear to lose. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, but Safari is a joy to use &#8211; when it works. Halfway through editing important information for a client, Safari crashed, and any code I was manipulating gone with it. Every few hours, Safari Web Content quits, and OS X reports that a &#8220;graphics problem has been found&#8221;, forcing me to restart.

What has forced Apple to abandon its attention to detail, aesthetics<sup id="fnref-255-1"><a href="#fn-255-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and, most importantly, function?

Could it be pressure from investors<sup id="fnref-255-2"><a href="#fn-255-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, or a push from Tim Cook, to focus on the impending release of the Apple Watch and the purported [Watch OS](http://www.apple.com/watch/technology/#familiar)?

As for me, I trust Apple to get back on this, and spend the next year fixing the many issues that came alongside the great features pushed with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

  Like that navigation button throughout the system, which looks like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2014/11/25/ep-101">a butt crack</a>. Seriously, what is up with that?&#160;<a href="#fnref-255-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
