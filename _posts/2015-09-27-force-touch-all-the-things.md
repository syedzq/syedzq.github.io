About a month ago I replaced my 2012 15” MacBook Pro with this year’s latest model. The only changes between my previous MacBook and my current one is that I now have double the previous storage space — I used to have 256 GB, now I have 512, which is a huge difference that really shows when I’m working with hours of footage I need to edit for videos, and the many Adobe CC apps I have installed. The other noticeable change? [Force Touch](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/design-retina/#trackpad "Force Touch - MacBook Pro").

To be honest, I was kind of both dreading and excited by the change. I’ve read reviews like [Marco Arment’s review of the MacBook](http://www.marco.org/2015/05/19/mistake-one "Mistake One - Marco.org"), which criticize the Force Touch trackpad. Here’s what he said on the Force Touch trackpad on the MacBook One:

> The simulated click vibration does feel like a click, but not a good one. It offers three different firmness settings, none of which feel anywhere near as good as Apple’s trackpads with real buttons. It feels like what it is: mushing my finger against a fixed pane of glass that’s emulating the feel of a button and almost getting there, but not getting there. 

That does _not_ sound good.

In practice though, it’s much cooler. Now, I’m Force Touching _all the things_.

Firstly, the actual haptic feedback is pretty good. As Arment says earlier in the review, it’s a remarkable technical achievement. The clicks are satisfactory, but not as good as the old ones, but that’s _awesome_ when taking into account that this piece of glass doesn’t move at all. Now I’m used to it, and it’s perfectly fine.

Where it shines, though, is with Force Touch. What I love about Force Touch is the software implications of it. I love being able to Force Touch web links to preview them in a small window, just like “Peek” on the iPhone 6s, because opening the actual link seems like too much of a commitment, especially with shortened URLs and sites I haven’t heard of.

I can Force Touch words and phrases in any compatible application (of which Pages is _infuriatingly_ not one of), and they pop up with a dictionary definition. It’s faster than the previous three-finger tap, and supports more actions. I also love Force Touching file icons for Quick Look, and file names to rename them.

By far the _coolest_, though the least-used application of Force Touch is in its pressure sensitivity. That means I can apply more force when scrubbing through videos to fast forward _more_, and press down harder to make maps zoom in _faster_. This has applications in sketching, too. Like the Apple Pencil with the iPad Pro, when drawing an annotation in Preview, I can add a drawing, and add more pressure to have a broader stroke. It’s really cool.

In everyday usage, I end up using Force Touch a lot, whether it&#8217;s for Look up, which shows web page previews and dictionary definitions, or Quick Look on documents and images.
