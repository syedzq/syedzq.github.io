Students of the University of Applied Sciences in Potsdam, Germany have created some gorgeous mockups of iTunes, broken up into little pieces of software. While the choices of apps are dubious (there&#8217;s one _just_ for listening to albums), the UI choices of these students are invigorating.

Just look at this one, called [&#8220;Simplay&#8221;](http://interface.fh-potsdam.de/itunes/simplay/)&#8220;.

Despite the font choice of SF Compact (which I doubt was intentional), the user interface looks like a much better version of iTunes&#8217; MiniPlayer.

iTunes is bloated. If I could break up iTunes into smaller but _much_ better designed apps (both functionally and aesthetically), I&#8217;d pick these:

  * **Just one app that serves as a control panel for iOS.** That means an app you can manage software updates with, as well as sync content such as music and videos to. With the new focus as the &#8216;cloud&#8217; as the content hub, it won&#8217;t be as popular as other apps, for sure, but power users might enjoy having something like this around.

  * **One app for music.** Call it Apple Music, but stress the difference between downloaded and streamable content.

  * **One app for movies and TV shows.** Just a navigation bar, showing two buttons for movies, and TV shows, and segmented buttons for your library, &#8220;For You&#8221;, and Search.

  * **One app for podcasts.** It&#8217;s about time we got a decent podcast player for OS X.
