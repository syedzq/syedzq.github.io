I marathoned _Back to the Future_ last week, and I loved the scene where Biff pays a cab driver with this fingerprint &#8211; it reminded me of Apple Pay. While it _technically_ hasn&#8217;t happened mainstream yet, you can use [Apple Pay for Uber](http://blog.uber.com/applepay), without an account (before the ride, when you select a destination).
