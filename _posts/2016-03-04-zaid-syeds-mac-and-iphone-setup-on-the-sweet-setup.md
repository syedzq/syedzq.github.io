I had the great honor of having my Mac and iOS setup featured on _[The Sweet Setup</em>](http://thesweetsetup.com/), one of my favorite websites _ever_. If you&#8217;re (somehow) not familiar with them, I consider them to be _[The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com)_ of Apple software.</p> 

While my setup has changed a bit since the interview, conducted in May 2015, you&#8217;ll still find that a lot of the things I use on the software side remains the same. If you&#8217;d like a more recent perspective on what I use every day, allow me to point you to my [previous article](http://zaidsyed.com/2016/01/05/command-z-favorites-2015/) on my favorite software of 2015.
