Pedometer++ is one of the apps I love using every day, and [Underscore](http://david-smith.org/) is celebrating its millionth download with a story on how it was developed.

It&#8217;s worth looking at just for the screenshots of the first couple builds.

Underscore is one of the best developers coding for iOS right now, and this is a significant milestone for him.
