A gem by [Sébastien Page](http://twitter.com/sebastienpage) for [iDownloadBlog](http://www.idownloadblog.com/).

Although he hasn&#8217;t used it (duh), Page paints a great picture on how the Apple Watch makes various daily activities easier. Here&#8217;s a few great bits:

> 6.01am: We stop by Starbucks for a much-needed cup of java. With the Passbook app on my watch, I can simply have the barista scan my card barcode. No need for any physical transaction. No need to get iPhone out of my pocket either, obviously. 

Still waiting for Apple Pay.

> 6.09am: We’re on our way to the office. I get a notification from Waze app on my watch that there is an accident on the I-5 and traffic has come to a halt. I guess we’ll take the back roads to go to the office. 

I see this happening a lot.

> 6.18am: I use my iPhone for the first time today. I catch up on emails, and check Twitter for the latest news headlines. Looks like Google finally made Android Wear compatible with iOS. “What’s Android Wear?”, my colleague asks. 

I imagine this phenomenon will occur a lot — the Apple Watch will be good for so many simple tasks, you&#8217;ll forget the iPhone exists.

Also, Google hasn&#8217;t taken Apple&#8217;s approach to marketing it, so I expect that a lot of people don&#8217;t know what Android Wear is.

> 7.22am: We’re all set and ready to go to the airport. Tobias wants to call a cab. A cab? What is this? 1999? I raise my wrist, launch the Uber app and request a ride. We proceed to the elevator to go wait for our ride. 

A lot like [Back to the Future II](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2015/01/01/back-to-the-future-2-is-based-on-2015-how-close-did-we-get/).

> 9.45am: Southwest lady scans my boarding pass on the watch. She smiles at me telling me I’m the coolest passenger on that plane. She knows what she’s talking about! 

Passbook with airlines hasn&#8217;t taken off in Hong Kong. Still looking forward to it.

Great stuff from iDownloadBlog.
