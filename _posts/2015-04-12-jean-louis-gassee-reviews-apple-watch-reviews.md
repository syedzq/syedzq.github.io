_Meta_.

In one extravagant 1,700 word piece, Jean-Louis Gassée, former Apple executive, disses product reviews, media publications, [Nilay Patel&#8217;s sense of fashion](http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Nilay-Patel-Big-Band-Edited-2.png) and praises John Gruber&#8217;s review.

> These initial reviews say more about the Product Review genre than they do about the Apple Watch. As the word genre implies, there are rules. One is that you have to provide quotable fragments that support your view — think of how movie posters and trailers quote reviews. Second, write what you want but remember you still need to eat in this town. In the case of tech reviewers, “lunch” is being among the select few invited to do the next “under embargo” product review — you don’t want to go hungry. Third, you have to be “fair and balanced”: You must provide at least a hint of negativity, no matter what, so you won’t be perceived as having “sold out”. Lastly, you have to write quickly, steamroll annoying counter-narrative trifles, and use strong words. 

Despite the brash manner of his writing, I think he&#8217;s right.
