A great video by The Verge&#8217;s Video team about how color graders change the hues in a film to tell the story differently. It&#8217;s very short, clocking in at about three minutes, but it&#8217;s a brief look at how much color can change how a story is told.

Recently, I had the pleasure of making a short documentary for my Media Studies course, and despite being the editor, I took the color grading aspect of the post-production process lightly.

It&#8217;s clear that color grading _actually makes a substantial difference_. The video linked explains how color communicates different feelings and moods, and why the Hollywood convention of &#8216;blue-and-orange&#8217; tones are used so widely.

(Hint: It&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a wider contrast between the orange of skin tones, and opposite-facing blue of the background.)
