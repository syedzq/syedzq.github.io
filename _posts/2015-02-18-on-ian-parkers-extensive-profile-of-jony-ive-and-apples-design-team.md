I finally got around to finishing this amazing and detailed piece by Ian Parker. If you haven&#8217;t read it yet, it really does deserve your undivided attention – follow the title of this post to read it before coming back.

Firstly, this profile shows us the face of a new Apple, an open Apple. It has insights on some of the best-designed Apple products, with quotes straight from the horse&#8217;s mouth – in this case, Jony Ive.

One particular part which intrigued me was this:

> For the watch, it was a year before Ive settled on straps that clicked into slots. Ive later tested watchbands by wearing them outside the studio with other watches. The shape of the body, meanwhile, barely changed: a rectangle with rounded corners. “When a huge part of the function is lists”—of names, or appointments—“a circle doesn’t make any sense,” Ive said. Its final form resembles one of Newson’s watches, and the Cartier Santos, from 1904. 

I always thought that the circular design of the Moto 360 and later the LG G Watch R looked more _traditional_ and more honest to original watch designs, and aesthetically pleasing. While the concept of circular watches is appealing, I didn&#8217;t find the way Motorola and LG executed it to be right.

So when Apple announced that the Apple Watch would be a rounded rectangle, I was slightly taken aback, and wondered if the next generation of the Apple Watch would have the circular design. I know realize that design is more than just form. If the design of the circular smartwatch doesn&#8217;t permit natural usage – as Ive says with scrolling through lists – then the design is ultimately a failure. No matter how good something looks, it&#8217;s bad design if the function is distorted because of the design.

This so called &#8220;good design&#8221; is apparent in a lot of Apple products. While design dictates a lot of what Apple does, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the function and the original _purpose_ of the device has become lost just to satisfy the design of the device. That is why Apple&#8217;s devices are so successful – they have a healthy balance of both good design and function.
