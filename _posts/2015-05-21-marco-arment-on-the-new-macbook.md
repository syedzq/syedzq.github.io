I find this is a great review of the new MacBook. Once again, Marco Arment is not afraid to share his opinions readily with the world.

From the ten minutes I&#8217;ve used them in the Apple Store, I share similar concerns about the butterfly keyboard, and it looks like [others did, too](https://instagram.com/p/2ITxAxIO7p/?taken-by=syedzq).

At first, I also found the new Force Touch trackpad unsettling, and mostly agree with Marco&#8217;s sentiment about it, but I can understand that Apple needed it to make it that thin. But did they _need_ to make the MacBook as thin as it is at all?

And the worst thing is that even the new MacBooks Pros are featuring the Force Touch trackpads, for apparently no reason. (It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re going to make these thinner, too.)

Finally, Apple&#8217;s obsession with thinness is concerning, especially with so many performance and functional issues with the MacBook. I applaud Marco&#8217;s boldness in a mainly Apple-positive community, and it looks like he got [trashed by Mr. Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/05/21/marcobook) for this, as well.
