Great article by Frederic Filloux for the [Monday Note](http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/04/26/featured-on-tim-cooks-keynote-what-it-takes/), detailing what it took for the Stupeflix team (the creators of the Replay video editor app) to make it into Cook&#8217;s iPad Air 2 keynote.

> In September 2014, while at the Stupeflix Paris office, Nicolas Steegmann got a call from Apple in Cupertino. Once the caller identified herself, Nicolas knew something up. The contact came after Stupeflix presentations to Apple’s team in Paris. In rather elliptic terms, Steegman’s interlocutor said it would be great if two members of the company, a developer and a designer, could be in Cupertino the next day. ‘They will have to stay at least two weeks’, she said. 48 hours later, the team was on Apple’s campus. They quickly found themselves in a windowless room and given a straightforward brief: Devise the coolest possible demo for your app. No more details, no promises whatsoever. 

It&#8217;s road trip!
