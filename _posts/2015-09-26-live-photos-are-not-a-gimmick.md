Jeremy Olson on [Medium](http://medium.com):

> Okay, so nothing completely extraordinary… except now instead of a fairly common cute picture that I might have even deleted, I get a much more interesting, much more special, and much more distinguishable snapshot of the moment. I get the context, I get the feeling, and… I might even get something extra. 

This piece is great. I&#8217;m still wondering whether Live Photos should have their own album in Photos, because it&#8217;s hard to tell from a thumbnail of a bad photo what the shot is about. I&#8217;d rather Apple market it as a feature like HDR — not always on, but a choice you can implement by flipping a switch.
