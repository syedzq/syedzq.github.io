Matt Birchler ran a great battery life test with his phone firstly on normal power mode, then on Low Power Mode, a new battery-saving feature introduced in iOS 9. It&#8217;s not a scientific experiment, but it&#8217;s a good test to get some sort of idea of the difference between normal mode and Low Power Mode.

> One of my favorite new features of Apple’s iOS 9 is Low Power Mode. This feature is designed to kick in when you reach 20% battery remaining, and give you a little more time before you have to race to a charger. And while most iOS 9 reviews covered this mode briefly and determined it worked as advertised, I wondered what would happen if you used Low Power Mode all the time. I was surprised that no reviewer seems to have done this, so I took it upon myself to give it a try. I don’t have any standardized battery tests that I can do, so I simply spent the last 2 weeks alternating between using Low Power Mode all day, and not using it at all and comparing the differences. My findings are rather remarkable. 

Birchler says the phone burned through battery power 38% slower in Low Power Mode. That&#8217;s incredible.
