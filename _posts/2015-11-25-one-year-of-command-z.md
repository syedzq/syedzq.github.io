One year ago, I decided I wanted to contribute something more substantial to the community than just tweets or stupid quips. I can&#8217;t believe what I&#8217;m about to write, but it&#8217;s already been a year since I started this blog as a platform to communicate my own thoughts on technology, design, and media.

In this time, not only have I developed a tiny following of readers, but I&#8217;ve also had the opportunity to improve my own writing, and get acquainted with the nuances and practices in this community of technology bloggers that have helped me improve my own writing. By writing regularly, I&#8217;ve become better at voicing my thoughts in a way that I find engaging yet concise.

So far this year, I&#8217;ve written 320 posts (including link posts, and this one). That&#8217;s on average, 0.88 posts a day, a number I&#8217;m proud of. Of those 20 posts, 42 are [substantial articles](http://zaidsyed.com/category/articles) that I&#8217;ve worked hard on, while the rest are posts that serve only the purpose of linking to others&#8217; work and to add on thoughts. It&#8217;s not a ratio I&#8217;m proud of, but I&#8217;d like to see this improve in the future<sup id="fnref-1469-1"><a href="#fn-1469-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.

In addition to this blog, I&#8217;ve also launched other projects: [Yellow Signal](http://yellowsignal.com) on Medium, a review blog that isn&#8217;t as regular, but is a collection of app reviews and interviews with interesting people. Also, I&#8217;m launching a [podcast](https://twitter.com/syedzq/status/665142772073017344) in the near future that I hope will give listeners an interesting perspective on technology from a student&#8217;s perspective.

It&#8217;s only been one year, but I would say it&#8217;s a success: not in terms of metrics, but in terms of my own personal growth as a writer. Next year, I aim to focus on more substantial writing: while quantity may be a metric others are more interested in, my interests lie in quality. I don&#8217;t want to write &#8216;often&#8217;, I want to write _well_. Next year, even if the aforementioned numbers don&#8217;t increase, I want to write content that people actually enjoy.

  In fact, I&#8217;ve cut down on link posts after reading <a href="http://joecaiati.info/post/131752076040/dont-be-daring-fireball">Joe Caiati&#8217;s excellent post</a> arguing that newer blogs should not try to emulate <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> today, but rather to focus on writing more substantial pieces.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1469-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
