> According to a new report Monday, Apple has enlisted help of popular YouTubers such as Louis Cole and sketch comedy channel Wong Fu Productions who appear to be working in unknown capacity on future Apple promotions. 

Doing this is a great way for Apple to appeal and connect with the &#8216;youths&#8217;<sup id="fnref-1244-youths"><a href="#fn-1244-youths" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, as well as the community of people who follow these YouTubers — perhaps aspiring filmmakers themselves.

Perhaps in preparation for camera upgrades this fall with the iPhone 6s, Apple looks like they&#8217;re ramping up marketing by working with influential people who can appeal to young people and filmmakers.
