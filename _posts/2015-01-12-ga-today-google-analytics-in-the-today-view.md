iOS 8 brought a world of opportunity for developers, allowing for third-party keyboards, share sheet extensions, Today view widgets, and much more. Old and new developers alike have found innovative new ways to display data, reach out to other apps and the OS, and make life easier for users. It&#8217;s apps like [Clips](http://cleanshavenapps.com/clips) and [Workflow](https://workflow.is) which define innovation in the App Store.

A lot of people argue whether the App Store is full. Is there room for innovation? Certainly. Is it easy to innovate? Maybe not.

It&#8217;s only last year I started working on creating websites a lot, and I&#8217;ve launched this site late November. This site is very new, but I&#8217;m still at the stage where I need to track session, views, and other key data to see if this blog is going the right way. Despite it being a bit early, I took the time shortly after the New Year to evaluate my site: Is it going the way I want it to? What do I need to do to attract potential readers? For a while, I used the Google Analytics app for that information, but it lacks key integration with iOS. Then I found [GA.TODAY](http://ryanbrink.ca/ga-today/) by Ryan Brink. It followed the key concept of Today view widgets &#8211; showing information for the day (similar to Google Now), and was simple, and showed all I needed. The app allowed me to customize what I can see, and provided a nice graph to show me how this site is doing, hour-by-hour. It&#8217;s simple, neat, and it&#8217;s something no one has done before.

It&#8217;s an example of innovation in an already crowded market &#8211; finding new ways to express information. The app itself goes through a slightly convoluted process to sign in and configure, but once you get it set up, it&#8217;s something you&#8217;ll check everyday.

The developer is helpful, and has a clear goal in where GA.TODAY is going. GA.TODAY is available on the [App Store for $1.99](https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/ga.today-widget-for-google/id936871747?mt=8), but there is a [lite version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ga.today/id954186400?ls=1&mt=8) available too.

_**Disclaimer:** I have beta-tested GA.TODAY for a few weeks (free of charge), however the views of my review have not changed._
