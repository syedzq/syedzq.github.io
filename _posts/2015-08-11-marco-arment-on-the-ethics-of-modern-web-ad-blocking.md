> All of that tracking and data collection is done without your knowledge, and — critically — without your consent. Because of how the web and web browsers work, the involuntary data collection starts if you simply follow a link. There’s no opportunity for disclosure, negotiation, or reconsideration. By following any link, you unwittingly opt into whatever the target site, and any number of embedded scripts from other sites and tracking networks, wants to collect, track, analyze, and sell about you.

Right on point, Marco Arment. It seems almost in response to [James Thompson&#8217;s piece for iMore](http://www.imore.com/in-a-world-the-network), in which he believes that readers of free sites are in a &#8216;contract&#8217; to view ads in return for the content, which in my opinion, isn&#8217;t practical.

Great response by Arment — a publisher with ads on his site.

As for my use of adblocking — I use it, but whitelist sites by independent creators, regardless of the quality of the ads — in my experience, the best ads are those on indie sites.
