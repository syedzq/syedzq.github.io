> Todoist for Apple Watch is an evolution of the concept shared by the company earlier this year. The main screen displays your profile picture and karma level; below that, the app has a button to view tasks due today, which opens a list of tasks you can complete or edit directly from your Watch. The choice of making the Today button bigger than others and the only one to have a badge is a thoughtful one: with the limited and brief interactions of the Watch, it&#8217;s far more important to prioritize what matters today and right now. 

Great ideology. it&#8217;s what Apple Watch is about.
