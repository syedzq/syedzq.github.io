Microsoft are doing great stuff with what they do best – software. But they&#8217;ve also shown that they&#8217;re not afraid of taking risks now. I&#8217;m glad Nadella and the rest of Microsoft are purchasing great apps.

What&#8217;s more interesting though is how they&#8217;ll pull it off. Acompli wasn&#8217;t all that well-known and no one batted an eye at it until Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition and [Outlook for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8). Microsoft managed to add some new features and make it better, and everyone seemed to like it.

With [Sunrise](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunrise-calendar-for-google/id599114150?mt=8), it&#8217;s more interesting. I imagine a lot of Google Calendar users use Sunrise on iOS and Android, and if Microsoft does mess up something, they won&#8217;t be very happy, if they do the same thing that they&#8217;ve done to Acompli.

As for me, I stopped using Sunrise a while ago when I found out it didn&#8217;t have .ics support.
