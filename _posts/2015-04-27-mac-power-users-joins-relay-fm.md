Holy crap. [Mac Power Users](http://www.macpowerusers.com), one of my favorite podcasts, is joining [Relay FM](http://relay.fm), one of my favorite podcast networks. And that artwork is _gorgeous_.

Here&#8217;s Stephen Hackett on the Relay FM blog:

> I&#8217;ve listened to Apple podcasts for a long time, and with over 250 episodes published, Mac Power Users has been a constant listen of mine for years.
> 
> Mac Power Users isn&#8217;t just a podcast; it&#8217;s an institution. The guest list is impressive, with greats like Rod Roddenberry, Merlin Mann, Aisha Tyler and David Allen making appearances.
    
> That&#8217;s why today&#8217;s announcement is so exciting: MPU is joining Relay FM.
