My favorite new writing app, Ulysses, just launched their universal app to the world, adding an iPhone version of the professional writing app, after three months of beta-testing. Also check out their new site, which looks great, and expect a review on [Yellow Signal](http://yellowsignal.com) soon.

Meanwhile, as The Soulmen co-founder Marcus puts it so eloquently in the [blog post](http://ulyssesapp.com/blog/2016/03/whoomp-there-it-is/), write your fingers bloody.
