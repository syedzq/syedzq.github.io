Remember [this](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2015/03/10/john-gruber-this-is-far-better-than-i-feared-for-apple-watch/)?

We thought that Apple Watch was going to be slightly better with water than we&#8217;d thought. But if this video by [FoneFox](https://www.fonefox.com) proves anything, it&#8217;s that Apple Watch Sport is doing a whole lot better.

It appears to be functioning properly with no consequences in the shower (although I&#8217;d worry about water and soap building up near the edges of the Digital Crown, and also when going for a swim in a 1.2 meter swimming pool. They took it to the next step by submerging Apple Watch Sport in the pool for 15 minutes, and it still continued to work.

While it&#8217;s rated IPX7, and I wouldn&#8217;t recommend doing this, this serves as a proof of concept that the Sport (with no leather strap) can go a long way in terms of water resistance.
