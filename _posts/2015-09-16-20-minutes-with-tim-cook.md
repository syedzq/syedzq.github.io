John Paczkowksi got to spend a few minutes with Tim Cook while he was in New York for an interview on [The Late Show](http://zaidsyed.com/2015/09/16/tim-cook-on-the-late-show/), where he got to ask Cook a few questions about the iPhone 6s and iOS 9:

> But today they’re leaving the carefully orchestrated stagecraft behind for a real-world appearance. Things can go wrong, but Cook is relaxed, and as on point as ever. Like when BuzzFeed News asks about the privacy implications of Hey Siri — the always-on feature of the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus that lets people wake it with just those two words: “Hey Siri.”
> 
> “First you can decide you don’t want Hey Siri,” Cook responds. “But the real answer to that is that the information is held on the device and so it is not going back to Apple. Apple doesn’t have access to it. So there’s not privacy concerns I think, for most people, when the information is held on their device and they can encrypt it with their passcode.”
> 
> “Hopefully people will look at our stance on privacy in general and know that we’re not trying to operate outside of a fairly distinct line that we’re drawing,” Cook elaborates. “I hope that people trust us to do the right thing there.”
