In a blog post, [Dan Counsell](http://dancounsell.com), founder of [Realmac Software](http://realmacsoftware.com):

> Over the last few years, we’ve been looking at ways to go beyond just creating a blog or website on the Mac. We’ve always wanted to run our own blogs (both the Realmac one, and all our personal ones) on an online service. And today we’re announcing just that: Typed.com is a better blogging platform, built solely for its customers, that we’ll be launching later in the year. We are, however, doing things a little differently with Typed.com &#8211; this isn’t just a pre-announcement! 

This is great news for anyone interested in blogging, and it&#8217;s created by none other than the Realmac Software Team, creators of [Clear](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear) ([Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/clear-tasks-reminders-to-do/id504544917?mt=12), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clear-tasks-reminders-to-do/id493136154?mt=8)) and [Typed](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2014/12/10/a-typed-review/).

You can fund Typed.com on [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/typed-a-better-blogging-platform). By contributing $350, you become a founding member and receive a free Typed.com account for life.

Typed.com seems to have a monthly rate of $10<sup id="fnref-481-1"><a href="#fn-481-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, as the campaign states that 12 free months of Typed is worth $120.

And, in case you&#8217;re wondering:

> **What&#8217;s the difference between Typed.com and Typed for Mac**?
    
> I&#8217;m glad you asked. Typed is our distraction free markdown based writing app for the Mac. Typed.com is going to be an online blogging platform. Typed for Mac will eventually be able to publish directly to Typed.com &#8211; but first we need to finish Typed.com to enable this to happen

    I contacted founder Dan Counsell, and he confirmed that, indeed, it is $10/month.&#160;<a href="#fnref-481-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
