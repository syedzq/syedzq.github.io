Hilarious tale by Steven Levy on the [Backchannel](https://medium.com/backchannel):

> If it were a straight deal for HP to include Apple’s software, the fee might have been hundreds of millions of dollars. (Around that time, software companies were paying huge sums to have their products or services preinstalled, since people seldom deleted them and often used the default choices.) Even better, preinstalling iTunes was a way for Apple to stifle Microsoft’s competitor to the iTunes Music Store. As an Apple leader at the time puts it, “This was a highly strategic move to block HP/Compaq from installing Windows Media Store on their PCs. We wanted iTunes Music store to be a definitive winner. Steve only did this deal because of that.” [&#8230;]

> In return, HP got the right to sell iPods. But not in a way that could possibly succeed. Fiorna boasted to me that she would be able to sell the devices in thousands of retail outlets; up to that point Apple mostly sold them online and in its own stores. But by the time in mid-2004 that HP actually began selling its branded iPods, Apple was expanding to multiple retail outlets on its own. And soon after HP began selling iPods, Apple came out with new, improved iPods — leaving HP to sell an obsolete device. Fiorina apparently did not secure the right to sell the most current iPods in a timely fashion, and was able to deliver newer models only months after the Apple versions were widely available. 

I had no idea that this iPod existed, and I didn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s something that Apple would do, especially since only a few years ago Jobs himself killed all ties with licensing Mac OS to clones. Clearly, it&#8217;s a huge flop, but a great business move on account of Steve Jobs.
