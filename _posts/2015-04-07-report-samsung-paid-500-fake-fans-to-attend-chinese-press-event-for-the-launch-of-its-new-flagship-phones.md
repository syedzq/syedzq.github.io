> According to a report out of Shanghai, Samsung paid 500 people to pretend to be Samsung fans at a press conference held Friday in China to show off the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 edge. The 500 fake fans represented half of the 1000 who attended the event. According to someone who recruited &#8220;fans&#8221; for the manufacturer, Samsung was seeking people under 30 who looked like students. They were each paid the equivalent of $4.80 USD once they stuck it out at the event for at least an hour. The recruiters received the equivalent of $3.20 USD for each person they got to attend. 

Ridiculous and dishonest, but it gets better:

> Yet, half of the people at the event were taking pictures of the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge with an Apple iPhone. 

I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;ve come to expect more from multi-billion dollar companies.
