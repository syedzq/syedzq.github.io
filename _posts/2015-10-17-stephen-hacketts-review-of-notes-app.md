Stephen Hackett published a great, in-depth look at the new Notes app for iOS and OS X, released with the latest iteration of both OSes. I&#8217;ve been using Evernote as my &#8216;everything box&#8217; for the past year or so, but I&#8217;ve come to hate the service<sup id="fnref-1445-1"><a href="#fn-1445-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for its constant prompts to upgrade, the often terrible user experience, and the general sluggishness of the service over the past few months, which is why I&#8217;ve been delighted with Apple&#8217;s updates to the Notes app.

> First of all, sync has been rock solid in my experience. New notes and edits show up on my other devices within moments. All content is saved offline automatically, and with the app&#8217;s extension, its easy to save content from anywhere in iOS or OS X. 

Yes, unlike most of iCloud, sync is actually really good, and much better than Evernote&#8217;s in my experience. I thoroughly enjoy the quick syncing between notes from iOS to OS X, and vice versa.

One of my favorite features is the new multimedia support, and the link/content previews.

> Being able to mix content types is nice. Often, my notes are part text, part outline, coupled with a photo or screenshot of some type. Notes handles all this really well, and the application has a view in which you can see all attachments, across folders and notes for quick access. This is present on both the Mac and iOS apps, and I already really like it. 

I don&#8217;t understand why the drawing tools aren&#8217;t available on OS X, though. By far my biggest complaint is the still-awful UI with the faux-notepad lettering. This has _got_ to go.

> The new app still sports a textured background, and its text still has a slight shadow to it. It&#8217;s gross and makes the text a little harder to read than I&#8217;d like. The Mac app&#8217;s default font size is too small and there&#8217;s no way to bump it up across all notes.
