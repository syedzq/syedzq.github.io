I consider myself to be a web developer and designer. I also write on the side, but that&#8217;s quickly changing as I&#8217;ve developed into a better writer who can (hopefully) communicate my thoughts more clearly. Writing is something I hope to do more and more in the future, and there&#8217;s something about it that I love. But that&#8217;s a story for another time.

When I started this site back in November, I didn&#8217;t know what CMS I&#8217;d be using. I&#8217;ve been working with the web for the past few years, so I _knew_ all the services — [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com), [Weebly](http://weebly.com), [Wix](http://wix.com), and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org). Once I&#8217;d gotten the domain and hosting stuff done, it was up to me to find a CMS I wanted to use.

Rather than going around throwing my time and money around to services after a quick Google search, I decided to make a criteria of what a CMS should do for me.

Firstly, it had to be free. Call me cheap, a penny pincher, and say what you will, but I&#8217;m a student, and ideally, I wouldn&#8217;t like to spend a whole bunch of money on a blog back then I considered an experiment. I didn&#8217;t even know if I _wanted_ to blog back then, to be honest.

Second, it had to have some kind of community around it I could lean back on for support. That means forums, support pages, documentation, and all that great stuff that any popular CMS would have.

Third, I should be able to do what I want with it. It should be unrestrictive. If I want to go around editing core files, or change the installed software on my server, I should be able to. I&#8217;m a developer, and I want to be able to change the look of my site without having to rely on &#8216;themes&#8217;.

Let&#8217;s narrow down the options.

What&#8217;s _free_:
  
&#8211; **WordPress**. A popular option at that time, and there&#8217;s an important distinction to be made between Automattic&#8217;s [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com) service and the original, open-source [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org).
  
&#8211; **Static blogging platforms**. We&#8217;ve all heard of these at some point. Stuff like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com).
  
&#8211; Of course, **Tumblr**. A somewhat easy choice — it&#8217;s easy to &#8216;reblog&#8217; and add comments for linked posts<sup id="fnref-1272-1"><a href="#fn-1272-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.

What&#8217;s free _and_ has a great community:
  
&#8211; **WordPress**.
  
&#8211; **Tumblr**.

What&#8217;s free _and_ has a great community _and_ is power-user friendly:
  
&#8211; **WordPress**.

Over time, I&#8217;ve learned what WordPress(.org) has to offer, and quite frankly, I love it. I know a lot of others don&#8217;t like it, but it works for me, requires little effort, is free, and gives me full control over what _I_ want to do.

And that&#8217;s what I want<sup id="fnref-1272-2"><a href="#fn-1272-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.

  Although they&#8217;ve recently <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/3/9258925/tumblr-reblogs-redesign-mobile">changed</a> what traditional &#8216;blockquotes&#8217; looked like to favor what probably 99% of Tumblr uses.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1272-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

  Squarespace is a second popular choice among a lot of other bloggers in this space. I&#8217;ve checked it out, and I like it too — it&#8217;s simple and does everything for you, but power users can change a lot too. It does require a monthly subscription though, and I <em>hate</em> the way it handles pagination.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1272-2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
