A clear and polite letter from Taylor Swift to Apple regarding their three-month Apple Music free trial in artists are not paid.

> This is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs. 

She&#8217;s made this clear — but Apple has shown that they are supporting new artists, somewhat with the &#8220;Connect&#8221; feature.

> But I say to Apple with all due respect, it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation. 

Well done, Taylor Swift.
