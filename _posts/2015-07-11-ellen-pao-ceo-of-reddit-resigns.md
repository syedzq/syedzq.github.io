Mike Isaac, reporting for The New York Times:

> Ellen Pao became a hero to many when she took on the entrenched male-dominated culture of Silicon Valley. But sentiment is a fickle thing. Late Friday she fell victim to a crowd demanding her ouster as chief executive of the popular social media site Reddit.

This is disgusting. Reddit&#8217;s community, in my opinion, is half-filled with members who not only show _clear_ bigotry towards basically everyone who isn&#8217;t a white male aged 18-39. And when Pao reacted by [banning]() certain bigoted communities — called “subreddits”, most of Reddit threw a tantrum.

Reddit&#8217;s current community is best described how [Gruber put it](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/07/10/reddit-pao):

> Reddit: a terrible, childish community posting on a site owned by a terrible, dumbass company.

Fortunately, I&#8217;m happy there are a handful of good people putting Reddit to good use. CGP Grey and Myke Hurley use Grey&#8217;s [subreddit](http://cgpgrey.reddit.com) to answer the most popular questions after an episode of their excellent podcast, [Cortex](http://relay.fm/cortex/). In addition to that, Grey uses Reddit as a comment board for his [educational videos](http://youtube.com/cgpgrey). While I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/syedzq/status/619751697187876865) earlier that I would not be be going back to Reddit, I will still be scrolling through comments after an episode of Cortex or [Hello Internet](http://hellointernet.fm).
