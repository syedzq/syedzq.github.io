> If this is true, it would mean Today widgets from apps like Evernote and the just-re-blessed PCalc are in trouble.

> While I understand Apple wanting to keep the Today view limited to glanceable information, developers have built some very useful tools, and to ban them after being approved for some time doesn&#8217;t reflect well on the company. I hope Apple and third-party developers can find a middle ground. Today widgets are useful and make iOS more powerful without putting a large burden on users.

I use [Evernote](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/images/IMG_0166.png) and [Todoist](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/images/IMG_0165.png) regularly, so I guess I&#8217;m screwed.
