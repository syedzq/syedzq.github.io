Today at Apple&#8217;s Special Event held in the Bill Graham Civic Center, Phil Schiller announced that iCloud pricing tiers had dropped again, and now, they&#8217;re really competitive.

5GB is still free, but for just $0.99 per month, you can get 50GB of storage. 200GB will see you back $2.99, and a whole terabyte of iCloud storage is only $9.99. This is great competitive pricing, but the free storage is still a little low compared to 15GB for Google Drive.
