A great interview by John Gruber at Apple Store SoHo. Apple recorded the event, and it&#8217;s available as both an audio and video podcast. The book is greatâ€”I&#8217;ve been reading it for a day and it&#8217;s really insightful, and the &#8216;meet-the-authors&#8217; serves as a great look behind the scenes of the book. [Joe Caiati](http://twitter.com/joecaiati) also streamed a Periscope (pardon my use of incorrect verbs, I&#8217;m not aware of the new terminology) of the event.
