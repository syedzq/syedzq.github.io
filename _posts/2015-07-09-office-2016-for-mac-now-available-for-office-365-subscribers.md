Microsoft has finally launched an new version of Microsoft Office for Mac â€” the last version having been released in 2010.

Currently only available only for Office 365 (like yours truly, via my school), it&#8217;s available for purchase this September.

I&#8217;m happy with Ulysses and Pages for all my word processing needs, and I&#8217;m a firm believer in Keynote for presentations, but Excel is still the industry leader for spreadsheets.
