> The new iPod touch now has an 8 megapixel rear camera, a big increase from the previous 5 megapixel camera. The internals have also been brought up to date with a 64-bit A8 processor and an M8 Motion chip to track steps and elevation. The iPod touch still starts at $199 for a 16 GB device, with the 32 GB model available at $249 and $299 for 64 GB, but there's also a new 128 GB model for $399. Today's update to the iPod touch is the first since Apple released the fifth generation iPod touch in October 2012. 

What this means:

  * The iPod touch is here to stay
  * 16 GB devices are here to stay
  * Unless data plans vastly decrease, the iPod touch is still the go-to iOS device for most kids.
