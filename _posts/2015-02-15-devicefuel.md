My thanks to [Devicefuel](http://devicefuel.com) for supporting Command-Z this week. Devicefuel is a pretty cool website that features five cool apps for iOS, Android and Windows Phone every week. I&#8217;ve found some awesome apps I now use everyday because of Devicefuel.

You can also subscribe to their weekly newsletter if you&#8217;re not bothered to check the website every week.
