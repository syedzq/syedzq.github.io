A wonderful story by Deepak Singh about saying &#8220;Thank you&#8221; in the United States, and how different it is to showing gratitude in India.

We say &#8220;thank you&#8221; to easily, and so much, it means nearly nothing now. &#8220;Thank you&#8221; should _mean_ something other than just a form of acknowledgement.
