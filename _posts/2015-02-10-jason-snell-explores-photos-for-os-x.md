Jason Snell looks into what happens when you import iPhoto data into Photos. People were surprised that it simply didn&#8217;t duplicate the photos data. Turns out it&#8217;s something that goes back into Unix, called **hard links**.

There&#8217;s definitely one statement I agree with:

> Between UXKit and hard links, Photos is turning out to be an even more interesting bit of software than we might have expected.
