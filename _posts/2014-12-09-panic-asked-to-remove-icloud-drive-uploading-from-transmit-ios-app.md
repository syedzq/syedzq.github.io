[Panic](http://panic.com):

> Also, at Apple’s request, we had to remove the ability to “Send” files to other services, including iCloud Drive.
> 
> In short, we’re told that while Transmit iOS can download content from iCloud Drive, we cannot upload content to iCloud Drive unless the content was created in the app itself. Apple says this use would violate 2.23 — “Apps must follow the [iOS Data Storage Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/data-storage/) or they will be rejected” — but oddly that page says nothing about iCloud Drive or appropriate uses for iCloud Drive.
