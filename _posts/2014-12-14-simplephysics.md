Here&#8217;s Andrew Garrison, the developer of the newly released SimplePlanes on [r/AppHookup](http://reddit.com/r/apphookup):

> We launched a new game yesterday and as a promotion, I am giving away all of my other games for free 

Andrew Garrison is one of my favorite game developers, and SimplePhysics one of the only games I _really_ liked. Now&#8217;s an excellent opportunity to grab SimplePhysics and five of his equally awesome physics-based games (SimpleRockets, Dummy Defense, Santa&#8217;s Engineer, Bridge Basher and SkyWord).

And of course, support the developer by buying his new game [SimplePlanes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simpleplanes/id823869162?ls=1&mt=8), where you can build and test out planes (virtually, of course).
