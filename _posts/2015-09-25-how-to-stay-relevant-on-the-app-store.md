Good piece by [Matt Birchler](http://birchtree.me) on how developers can stay relevant on the App Store.

This is the key bit, about [_David Smith](http://david-smith.org):

> You likely notice a pattern here, as David Smith is also following Apple’s platform as it grows. Unlike Drafts, which is a single product growing, David’s library of apps is growing. Looking at the last couple years, his new apps have been created specifically for the new things possible in iOS updates:
> 
>   * Pedometer++ &#8211; iOS 7, the M7 chip in the iPhone 5S
>   * Emoji++ &#8211; iOS 8, 3rd party keyboards
>   * Sleep++ &#8211; iOS 9, native Apple Watch apps
> 
> When you download the new version of iOS or take home the new iPhone, odds are that David Smith will have an app available that you can download to take advantage of those new features. 

David Smith is a great and active developer. He&#8217;s fast at developing software and leverages launch day well. He learns about a key feature or API, comes up with a great app idea using it, and churns it out on launch day — it may not look the best then, but he gets those downloads straight from the start, then makes it much better with coming updates. Case in point? [Pedometer++](https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/05/11/hitting-one-million/).
