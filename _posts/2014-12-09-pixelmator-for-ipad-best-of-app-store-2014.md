Saulius Dailide, on a blog post celebrating Pixelmator&#8217;s success on the [App Store Best of 2014](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewFeature?id=940869979&mt=8):

> There are no words to describe how happy we are. Believe me, no one could be any more excited than we are.
> 
> We worked really hard on Pixelmator for almost two years: staying late at night and working weekends researching, adding, perfecting, polishing, then repeating the same process again and again to build or improve the features and core foundation of the app to impossibility â€“ all that for you to later notice or simply feel the awesomeness of Pixelmator for iPad.
> 
> We honestly want you to enjoy Pixelmator on your iPad to its utmost. 

It&#8217;s amazing seeing the progress of the Pixelmator Team, evolving from small, indie Mac app developers into one of the most well-known developers in the Mac and iOS app spheres. As a long-time user, Pixelmator has always had the best support and commitment to their apps.
