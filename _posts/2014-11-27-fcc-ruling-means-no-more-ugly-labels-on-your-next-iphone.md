> On otherwise flawless devices that strip away any unnecessary components, the ugly small print on the back of an iPhone or iPad — including the serial number, FCC logo, CE logo and model number — has always stood out.

> Well, thankfully Jony Ive and the rest of his design-obsessed team can finally do away with it for good, thanks to the E-label Act law signed in by President Obama on Wednesday. The bill, which unsurprisingly was heavily supported by those in the tech industry, means that gadget makers can now add software-based labels as opposed to having to print the identifying information onto their hardware.

I genuinely don&#8217;t know how to feel. Though the overall finish may look cleaner, I always admired the iconography at the back. If they going to strip out the FCC-required labels, I&#8217;d rather they do away with everything except the Apple logo and the &#8216;iPhone&#8217; text &#8211; including &#8220;Designed by Apple in California&#8221;. I&#8217;d miss having the model number handy, though.
