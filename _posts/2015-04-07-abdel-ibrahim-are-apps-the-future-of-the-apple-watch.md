Abdel Ibrahim on [The Tech Block](thetechblock.com):

> In an ideal world, none of these things would even require apps that you’d have to open. You simply walk up and boom! — whatever you were expecting to authenticate does so without any issue, just based on your physical presence and a learned pattern of expectation. IFTTT for the real world. There is no app for that. 

And:

> If the idea is to remove friction, then part of that mandates at least some removal of the need to touch the display. 

Great stuff from Ibrahim.
