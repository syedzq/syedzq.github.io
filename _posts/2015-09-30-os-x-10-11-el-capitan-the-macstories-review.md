This is one of the best reviews you&#8217;ll read of this year&#8217;s desktop operating system.

> El Capitan marks an end to Apple&#8217;s relentless march forward, opting instead for a calm retrospective on the applications and underlying frameworks which have been the keystones of the operating system for years. Portentous in its own restraint, 10.11 canonizes those small but significant features that enrich the OS X experience in daily use. Shaving off seconds and bandaging cuts, El Capitan is the operating system we&#8217;ve been looking for.
