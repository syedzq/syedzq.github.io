Marco Arment decided to pull the plug on Peace, his very new content-blocking app based on [Ghostery](http://ghostery.com):

> Achieving this much success with Peace just doesn’t feel good, which I didn’t anticipate, but probably should have. Ad blockers come with an important asterisk: while they do benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don’t deserve the hit.
> 
> Peace required that all ads be treated the same — all-or-nothing enforcement for decisions that aren’t black and white. This approach is too blunt, and Ghostery and I have both decided that it doesn’t serve our goals or beliefs well enough. If we’re going to effect positive change overall, a more nuanced, complex approach is required than what I can bring in a simple iOS app. 

This is a sad a demise for Peace, but still a highlight in Arment&#8217;s career to make a #1 Top Paid app (even if it&#8217;s for just a while). Congratulations, Marco.
