> It used to be said that iPads couldn’t be used for “real” work. While that may still be true for some (though decreasingly so), we writers in particular have found the iPad an excellent tool to sling words with. 

Great guide, and I agree with most of these choices. I rarely blog from my Mac anymore — Editorial is much more powerful, easier to use, and has everything in one place, so that I can perform complicated workflows easily which I previously couldn&#8217;t while using other apps on my Mac.

The best part is that Editorial is universal, so I can even blog on the go when some big news hits from my iPhone.
