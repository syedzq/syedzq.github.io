Interesting piece by Marco Arment. I love Apple, but I don&#8217;t share much of the same feelings about Google. Google Photos was the first product in a long time that made me go back. I love it, but I&#8217;m still not completely confident about switching over because I do _not_ want Google looking at my stuff. It&#8217;s simple.
