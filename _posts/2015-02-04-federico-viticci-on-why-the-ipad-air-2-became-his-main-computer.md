I imagine Federico had a good time writing this one. Here&#8217;s why he originally started using an iPad for daily work:

> First, some context. Three years ago, as I was undergoing cancer treatments, I found myself in the position of being unable to get work done with a Mac on a daily basis because I wasn&#8217;t always home, at my desk. I was hospitalized for several weeks or had to spend entire days waiting to talk to doctors. I couldn&#8217;t write or manage MacStories because I couldn&#8217;t do those tasks on my iPhone and I couldn&#8217;t take my MacBook with me. I&#8217;d often go weeks without posting anything to the website – not even a short link – because I couldn&#8217;t do it from my bed. I began experimenting with the iPad as a device to work from anywhere and, slowly but steadily, I came up with ways to speed up my workflow and get things done on iOS. I promised myself I&#8217;d never let a desk set my work schedule or performance anymore. 

This essentially ties into [last week&#8217;s Connected](http://www.relay.fm/connected/24), in which Federico & Co. discussed if the iPad will ever replace MacBooks for long-form work. Federico&#8217;s piece acts as an insight into a phenomenon that could be prevalent in the future.
