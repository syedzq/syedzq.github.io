Harry Nesbitt on the development process of Alto&#8217;s Adventure:

> Ryan first reached out to me back in January 2013 with the seed of an idea: to create an endless 2D snowboarding game that involved landing backflips and jumping chasms.
> 
> Apart from a few rough sketches, the game was pretty much a blank canvas, and Ryan was keen to give me creative freedom to design the entire look and feel, including characters, environments, items and animations. [&#8230;] 

The most interesting bit:

> By now, you may be wondering how someone with a background in illustration and no prior experience in game development also ended up working as sole programmer for an iOS game. Well, to be honest, I’m still not entirely sure! 

I previously thought Nesbitt served only as the art director, and not as one of the _developers_ of the game. I was wrong. It&#8217;s worth the read, especially for his experience going from illustrations to code.
