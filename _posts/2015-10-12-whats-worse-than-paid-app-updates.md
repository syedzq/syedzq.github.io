[Dan Edwards](https://medium.com/@de), writing on Medium:

> So next time you feel the urge to complain about a paid upgrade, consider the people behind it and support them, and if you don’t want to, don’t. But there’s no need to call them greedy assholes, because they’re not. 

I realize I&#8217;m late to this discussion by about a week, but I&#8217;d like to offer my thoughts anyway.

These people spend years working on an expansive update to a great app like [Tweebot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-4-for-twitter/id1018355599?mt=8) which I absolutely _adore_. That&#8217;s years spent developing an app they don&#8217;t know will do well, with no corporate hovering over them with a paycheck. And when they revamp the whole app and relaunch it as a paid upgrade — for $5 at launch — users complain, and hurl insults.

One of the things that caught my eye was this tweet embedded in Edwards&#8217; piece:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    <a href="https://twitter.com/_JeRD_">@_JeRD_</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/markjardine">@markjardine</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tapbots">@tapbots</a> the App is NOT worth $10. Its not worth $5, its not even worth 0.99 For those who have purchased it twice
  </p>

This person is completely insensitive to the tweet he replied to:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    To those mad we are charging for the update, this tweet still stands true. There are free alternatives.&#10;&#10;<a href="https://t.co/temFfZ073p">https://t.co/temFfZ073p</a>

I find this completely ludicrous, because:

  1. Buying an app any number of times doesn&#8217;t entitle you to a free upgrade, especially when;
  2. The developer(s) are independent and are only supported by the money they make from the app.
  3. The update is actually expansive, it includes an app rebuilt ground-up for another platform, and because _$10 is not a lot of money for an app_.

&#8216;DHH&#8217; also writes on Medium, in a piece entitled [&#8216;Don’t base your business on a paid app&#8217;](https://medium.com/@dhh/don-t-base-your-business-on-a-paid-app-a6440f33dd4c):

> Apple and Google both benefit from having apps be as cheap as possible. For Apple, that means people will buy an iPhone more readily when the cost to fill it with software is near nil. For Google, it means app makers have to shove ads into products to make them pay. Win-win-lose. 

Developers, _do not be afraid to charge more money for your app_. I happily purchased Tweetbot 4, and I&#8217;ll keep doing it for every app I like.
