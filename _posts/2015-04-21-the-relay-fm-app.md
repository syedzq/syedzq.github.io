I&#8217;ve [previously written about why I love podcasts](http://zaidsyed.com/blog/2015/02/14/why-i-love-podcasts/), and Relay FM is one of my favorite podcast networks out there today.

Today, courtesy of [Glide](http://createglide.com), they&#8217;ve created their own app. Of course, you may be of the notion that it does nothing that any podcatcher, such as my favorite, [Overcast](http://overcast.fm) can&#8217;t already do. That&#8217;s incorrect, as seen from the promotional video, which features the option to live-stream podcasts currently playing on both Apple Watch, iPhone and iPad — the killer feature for me.
