I reviewed [Soulver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soulver-notepad-calculator/id348142037?mt=8) for my sister site, [Yellow Signal](http://yellowsignal.com/soulver-the-calculator-reinvented/).

I guess what&#8217;s happening now is that Yellow Signal is becoming a place where I review and interview people, and this site is where I write meta-ish things and linked list posts. I&#8217;m not sure how to bide my time between both, and duplicating posts would be suspicious. I should redefine the purpose of Yellow Signal so that I can still get quality content for this blog.
