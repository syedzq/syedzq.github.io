Stephen Hackett has a great writeup on how he uses his Apple Watch at night, as a sleep tracker using [Sleep++](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep++/id1038440371?mt=8) by [David Smith](http://david-smith.org).

> The Watch&#8217;s screen will still light up when moved, even at night, and I found that to be a problem, so right before bed, I&#8217;ve been knocking the screen brightness all the way down and selecting this variant of the Modular face I&#8217;ve setup to show just the time in red. Now, if I do turn over, the Watch&#8217;s display shouldn&#8217;t be bright enough to be an annoyance.
