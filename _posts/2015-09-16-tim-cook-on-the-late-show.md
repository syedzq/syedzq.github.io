A good recap by Dawn Chmielewski on Tim Cook&#8217;s interview with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show.

> Colbert indulged in a bit of product promotion, showing off the new rose gold colored iPhone 6s and conducting a short demonstration, with Cook walking him through the features of its new touch-sensitive screen.
> 
> “Oh, that’s awesome. It kind of touches me back,” Colbert quipped, adding, “If I hang up hard enough on someone, will it actually hit them on the other side?”
