Recently, two new apps were launched for Apple Watch [DeskConnect](http://deskconnect.com) team recently announced [Workflow](http://workflow.com/watch) for Apple Watch. In a short interview with [Federico Viticci](http://macstories.net), Weinstein mentioned that 163 of 226 Workflow actions would run natively on the Apple Watch, and impressive feat. Normally, as the Watch app is an extension to the iOS app, actions involving Safari and other apps will instead use Handoff to launch on iPhone.

Similarly, [1Password](https://blog.agilebits.com/2015/04/14/1password-5-4-for-ios-the-go-go-gadget-watch-edition/) released their Watch app on the App Store as part of the $9.99 Pro upgrade to the iPhone app, one of the first examples of monetization. While not exactly useful for viewing passwords. 1Password describes the Watch app as a natural destination for one-time passwords (for two-factor authentication), viewing notes and for passwords for garage doors and the like.

> You donâ€™t need to be an intrepid inspector (or a precocious crime-solver in pigtails) to appreciate the awesomeness of having 1Password on your wrist. 1Password for Apple Watch helps you find the little pieces of secret info you need every day, quickly and easily. If you need the code to open your garage door, one of your one-time passwords, or to look up the Konami Code for those extra lives when playing Contra, 1Password is right there for you.
