Marco Arment, the developer of Overcast:

    Well, Overcast linking to competing apps is over. I knew it would get rejected eventually.&#10;&#10;Not mad, just annoyed at the resubmission delay.

I use Overcast everyday and I found the section in question _very_ diplomatic. It&#8217;s a very&#8230;nice move, like Marco Arment &#8211; forgoing an edge in competitiveness to support other independent developers.
