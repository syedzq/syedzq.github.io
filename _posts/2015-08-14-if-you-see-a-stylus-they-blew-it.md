These words were famously said by Steve Jobs back at Macworld, January 9, 2007. Jobs was describing the multi-touch input that was (and still is) the primary interface to the iPhone.

Before moving on to introduce the multi-touch technology, Steve went on a mini-rant about how fiddly styluses were<sup id="fnref-1214-1"><a href="#fn-1214-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. “You have to get ‘em, and put ‘em away, and you lose ‘em. &#42;Yuck&#42;. _Nobody_ wants a stylus.”

It’s been eight years since Macworld 2007, and nobody’s ready yet to move on. Every time a rumor comes along mentioning a stylus, someone _always_ mentions that [Steve Jobs have would never approved of it](http://www.cultofmac.com/309293/steve-jobs-rolls-grave-ipad-pro-stylus/ "Steve Jobs rolls over in his grave: iPad Pro could have a stylus") — whether it was the original iPad, or the iPhone 6 Plus, every single time a new report comes out about Apple making a stylus, people are quick to point out how much Steve Jobs hated styluses, eight years ago.

And I agree with Steve Jobs. Styluses as touch input tools are a _terrible_ idea, _especially_ for a 3.5-inch screen in 2007. Sure, they have a smaller tip and are more “accurate”. But software touch targets are larger now, and using our fingers for touch input is natural, and much more intuitive than using a stylus. But for the larger screens of today, styluses are _much_ more useful, just in a different way.

## “Nobody Wants a Stylus”

Whether you like it or not, times — and with it, screen sizes — have changed. With larger screens, people do more with their iPhones, ranging from playing games to taking notes for their business meetings.

Styluses have changed, too, or at least what they are used for. Back in the pre-iPhone days, they shipped with the Palm smartphones so that users’ grubby fingers wouldn’t leave smudges all over the terrible resistive screen. Let&#8217;s just say it wasn&#8217;t the best experience to use your fingers.

These days, people are using styluses for very different things. Drawing, sketching, note-taking, designing, prototyping. These make _much_ more sense on larger screens.

With iOS 9’s official release coming up soon, more and more people are looking at the iPad’s advanced new features and are seriously [considering switching to it for work](https://500ish.com/crossing-the-ipad-rubicon-51bbdb52bf48 "Crossing the iPad Rubicon by MG Siegler"), especially with the expected 12.9-inch “iPad Pro” ([which allegedly will ship with a stylus](http://www.cultofmac.com/309293/steve-jobs-rolls-grave-ipad-pro-stylus/ "Steve Jobs rolls over in his grave: iPad Pro could have a stylus")).

The argument that styluses are redundant today is invalid; a lot of people will find styluses useful, whether for writing, taking notes, sketching or making art on their tablets. It’s not hard to imagine a creative director at a marketing firm making a mind map on an iPad Pro with a stylus, or an executive at a Fortune 500 company taking notes at a meeting.

A lot has changed since 2007, from the way we use our devices to how we interact with them. Styluses aren’t the same — as people find new ways to use these tools, I believe that styluses _do_ have a future, even beyond multinational Korean companies.
