I reviewed Fantastical 2 for Mac by [Flexibits](http://Flexibits.com) over on [Yellow Signal](http://yellowsignal.com/reviews/fantastical-2-review-desktop-calendaring-at-its-finest/). It&#8217;s a great app, and I find it the best calendar app for Mac. Fun review, and written and published entirely from my iPad.
