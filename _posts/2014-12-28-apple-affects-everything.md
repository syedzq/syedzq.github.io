A great article written by Eric Ravenscraft found in [Lifehacker&#8217;s Most Popular Features and Essays of 2014](http://lifehacker.com/most-popular-features-and-essays-of-2014-1671909445). I&#8217;m mad that I didn&#8217;t find it before.

> Of course, no one&#8217;s saying Apple&#8217;s the only one that drives competition or the only one who comes up with ideas. But it does popularize many of them. No one&#8217;s giving credit solely to Apple for inventing all technology (or at least not reasonably so). Just because Apple prefers a walled-garden approach to tech, though, doesn&#8217;t mean it actually lives in one. 

(You should check out the other articles in Lifehacker&#8217;s collection, too. I have a about a ton of them saved in my Instapaper reading list.)
